It has been available for beta testing for a number of months, and R users may have wondered if they should try it or if it will be a good fit for them. This new IDE is an extensible tool built to facilitate exploratory data analysis, reproducible authoring, and publishing data artifacts, and it is an IDE that supports but is not built only for R. How should an R user think about Positron, compared to the other options out there? In this talk, learn about how and why Positron is designed the way it is, what will feel familiar or new coming from other IDEs such as RStudio, and when (or if) people who use R should consider giving it a try. You’ll hear about different choices when it comes to defaults and ways of working, such as how to think about your projects or folders and how to manage multiple versions of R. You will also learn about new functionality for R users and package developers that we have never had before, like new approaches for managing R package tests and the ability to customize an IDE using extensions. If you are curious about Positron and how it fits into the R ecosystem, you’ll come away from this talk with more details about its capabilities and more clarity about whether it may be a good choice for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>✅</td><td>ide, workflow, tooling                                                                                       </td><td>Julia Silge (Posit PBC)                                                                                                        </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

Participants will gain a foundational understanding of how Census data is structured and learn how to apply statistical weights to create representative analyses. The talk also explores the role of Census data in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), highlighting its applications in model training, fairness assessments, and demographic insights. Finally, the course addresses the critical use of Census data in anti-discrimination frameworks, demonstrating how demographic techniques can help evaluate bias and promote equitable AI/ML outcomes. Through practical exercises and case studies, participants will develop essential skills for integrating Census data into AI-driven analyses with an emphasis on equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>✅</td><td>demography, frameworks, census data, equity ml/ai, anti-discrimination in ml/ai                              </td><td>Joanne Rodrigues                                                                                                               </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

With such, we can eliminate the need for manual interventions. In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can use plumber, an R package for building APIs, to create a webhook listener that triggers your workflows such as updating dashboards, triggering machine learning retraining, and other potential use cases. In the presentation, I will cover how to process payloads - using GitHub webhooks as an example, verifying authenticity using HMAC signatures, and implementing logging for tracking script execution, debugging, and monitoring. This talk will benefit researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to make their R workflows responsive to certain triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>✅</td><td>automation, event-driven workflows, plumber api, github webhooks                                             </td><td>CLINTON DAVID                                                                                                                  </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

Traditional measurement methods often fall short, leaving marketers with more questions than answers: Is TV a dead channel? Is last-click attribution selling your brand-building efforts short? Are you overinvesting in one channel while under-utilising another? In this talk, we will take you beyond surface-level metrics and into the world of econometrics in R: the gold standard for understanding marketing effectiveness. By applying time-series regression techniques, we can move past vanity metrics and gut feelings to uncover the real impact of marketing spend. Attribution is one of the biggest debates in marketing measurement, therefore, this talk will also explore whether first-click, last-click, or equal weightings really make sense - or whether a more nuanced approach is needed to reflect consumer behaviour. Next, we’ll explore how to quantify return on investment with rigor, determine the optimal allocation of budget across channels, visualise the relationship between channels, and understand diminishing returns to avoid wasted spend. All while breaking down key marketing acronyms, campaign types, and measurement approaches to ensure you leave with a clear understanding of how to apply these concepts in the real world. Finally, we will demonstrate our award-winning (IPA, 2024) example case study built in R with December19 Media Agency, for Xero Accounting UK, to bring our time-series regression analyses to life.

CSV format is advantageous for its simplicity. When the data size is small, it is easy to inspect the CSV data using a spreadsheet program. However, CSV files tend to become very slow for read and write operations at larger data sizes. Enter Apache Parquet &gt; Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming language and analytics tools. From Apache Parquet Documentation The talk would focus on an overview of the Apache Parquet format and advantages compared to the CSV format. I would also demonstrate reading and writing data in this format in R and show the interoperability with Apache Arrow. Further, I would demonstrate how this format would make life easier for polyglot teams that use R and Python. Finally, the session would end by mentioning key points to consider to decide their storage format.

While there are good guidelines on how to report the results, data visualization tools are rarely used in understanding the results of EFA. Good data visualization, especially in a multivariate framework with ordinal data, makes it easier for people interpret the results of the analysis better. This presentation introduces and demonstrates different data visualization techniques that can be used to illustrate the results of EFA and improve its interpretation. Advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques are discussed. As EFA is oftentimes used on categorical data from survey research, apart from visualizations for the factor results, exploratory data visualization for categorical variables are also presented. Moreover, these graphical tools can be used for purposes other than EFA. Data visualization and analysis is performed in R using publicly available survey research data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>✅</td><td>factor analysis, exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction, ordinal data, survey research               </td><td>Nivedita Bhaktha (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur)                                                                       </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

This pipeline was instrumental in allowing the review and use of 2.2 billion rows/175 GB of source data. During the process of developing the sepsis criteria, we received multiple new data deliveries from each site, which required frequent review and re-harmonization of the provided source datasets. This harmonization pipeline consisted of multiple steps including conflating multiple source rows types to one harmonized type, performing source specific unit mapping, and performing value transformations. In an iterative process, clinical experts would identify rows for mapping, data scientists would run the harmonization pipeline, and then clinical experts would review mapped data using Shiny tools custom built for this project. Due to project and dataset size, we leveraged a range of tools including Google BigQuery, R, and make. After harmonization, the cleaned dataset was approximately 1.7 billion rows/155GB in size. This large amount of data required special considerations to perform acceptably. To keep Shiny responsive, to keep the server hosting our Shiny apps from crashing, and to prevent client browser crashes, we had to limit data being reviewed to at most a random sample of 50% of the larger data groupings. ![Application Screenshot][1] [1]: https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/9376248/421070526-1ced6919-a0f8-4dac-9561-afb442c48161.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zYshCSHQCOw9AKIrUIEb15KvmI2lqsls0s-wjxhxE2E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>✅</td><td>big data, shiny, healthcare, data harmonization, rdbms                                                       </td><td>Seth Russell (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)                                                                  </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

Clinicians currently make decisions about placing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor in children with traumatic brain injury without the benefit of an accurate clinical decision support tool. In a prospective observational cohort study, we developed and validated models that predict placement of an ICP monitor. Patient data was gathered from multiple sources and discretized into 5-minute intervals. We divided data into four combinations of nurse documented and chart extracted input data, all including patient level and vital sign variables, and with inclusion or exclusion of data from brain computed tomography imaging reports and invasive blood pressure readings. Using R, we built machine learning models using logistic regression, support vector machines, generalized estimating equations, generalized additive models, and LSTMs. We trained each model with each combination of data. Optimal parameters were identified based on the highest F1. The best performing model, an LSTM deep learning model, achieved an F1 of 0.71 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. The best non-neural network model, standard logistic regression, achieved an F1 of 0.36 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. While non-RNN models did not achieve the best F1, their coefficient size and direction provide insight into factors predicting ICP monitor placement. Additionally, the generalized additive models allow for visualization and interpretation of the marginal impact (after integrating out the impact of the other variables) of a variable over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>✅</td><td>deep learning, machine learning, healthcare, decision making                                                 </td><td>Seth Russell (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)                                                                  </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

It allows to submit packages through a user interface or API and to automatically update and publish R and Python repositories. Multiple departments can manage their own repositories and different users can have different roles in the management of their packages. With continuous integration infrastructure for quality assurance on R and Python packages, package uploads can be automated. All configuration is declarative and RDepot can be set up as infrastructure as code, which is especially relevant in regulated contexts, since it makes validation activities much easier. Packages from publicly available R repositories such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages) can be mirrored selectively in custom repositories for use behind a firewall, in internal networks and offline. Combined with [Crane](https://craneserver.net), authentication and fine-grained authorization (using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)) can be configured per repository, which offers extra security when dealing with sensitive data or sensitive methodology. In this talk we will walk R users and developers through different features of RDepot and demonstrate how these can be useful in different scenarios. The logic of the different workflows will be explained and live demos will be given to see the open source solution in action. We will make sure to address needs ranging from small research groups sharing a handful of packages up to multinational companies managing their R (and Python) code across the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>✅</td><td>package management, infrastructure, open source                                                              </td><td>Jonas Van Malder                                                                                                               </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

This is a problem for many data science organizations and can now be solved using a novel open source product Crane (https://craneserver.net/). Crane hosts data science artifacts such as data analysis reports, documentation sites, or even packages and libraries. All of these data science artifacts are kept under strict authentication and authorization using modern protocols (OIDC). In this talk, we walk you through the different features of Crane and provide a live demo to explain the concepts. We will discuss its configuration file and demonstrate that authentication in Crane is fully declarative and allows for fine-grained configuration (at user-level, group-level, network-level or using SpEL) while still using an intuitive hierarchical tree that corresponds to the directory structure of the data. Next, we will show how artifacts can be accessed from or uploaded into Crane using the Crane API from R (e.g. to automate report updates, use data science artifacts in CI/CD) or using its customizable UI. Further, we zoom in on audit logs to track operations on all files (e.g. for GxP purposes) and detail the different storage backends (S3 and local file system). To ensure Crane can perform in high security settings the code base has been tested using integration tests reaching a high code coverage of more than 70%. With this talk we want to teach any R user and developer the essentials of Crane and how it can be used to share their data science artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>✅</td><td>data sharing, data, automation, r, repository managment                                                      </td><td>Lucianos Lionakis (Open Analytics)                                                                                             </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

In this talk, we will explore how to take Shiny beyond it’s default appearance to create dashboards that are not only visually appealing but also highly usable, accessible, and seamlessly integrated into an organisation’s digital environment. To demonstrate this to our audience, we will share our open-source dashboard in collaboration with the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). While the project required thorough data integration and analysis, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring the dashboard was not just functional but also visually cohesive, highly accessible, and intuitive for a broad range of users—including policymakers with varying levels of data literacy. We’ll start by discussing how to balance the line between over-simplifying and over-complicating data. Like most open-source data, there is a vast library of data, with little documentation on how to interpret it. Therefore, how to optimise open-source government underpins this talk – to ensure interactivity and efficient rendering techniques, so we can keep dashboards responsive and user-friendly. Next, we will be jump into customisation now that the foundations are in place - looking at how custom CSS and JavaScript can be leveraged to break free from the typical Shiny aesthetic, ensuring dashboards align with existing brand guidelines and user expectations. From typography and colour schemes to interactive elements, we’ll discuss techniques to create a polished, professional design that feels like a natural extension of an organisation’s existing web presence. Accessibility is another key factor in dashboard design. Many users—whether government policymakers, corporate stakeholders, or public audiences—have varying levels of data literacy, and a poorly designed interface can create barriers to insight. We’ll cover strategies for making dashboards more intuitive, including thoughtful navigation structures, tooltips, dynamic summaries, and alternative ways to display data for users with different needs. Additionally, we’ll explore best practices for ensuring compliance with accessibility standards, such as improving contrast, enabling keyboard navigation, and implementing screen reader-friendly elements. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to design Shiny dashboards that are not just functional but genuinely enjoyable to use - helping your audience engage with data more effectively and make better-informed decisions with open-source data.</td><td>✅</td><td>shiny apps, dashboard, environmental science, health science, decision-making, customisation                 </td><td>Abbie Brookes; Jeremy Horne (Director @ Datacove)                                                                              </td><td>Abbie Brookes                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

Because of it's flexibility, ShinyProxy is being used by both small startups and large enterprises. Although ShinyProxy was originally tailored towards hosting Shiny apps, it can host virtually any web app. Since ShinyProxy makes it easy to make reproducible apps, even when using multiple R versions, it's often used by pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, it's used by financial and engineering companies as well. ShinyProxy seamlessly integrates with your existing infrastructure (such as authentication providers and databases). The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction to ShinyProxy, explain the use-cases of ShinyProxy and it's unique advantages over other solutions. No deep technical knowledge (e.g. of Docker or Linux) is needed to follow this talk, however, the talk will give you enough information to start using ShinyProxy yourselves. As usual, the development of ShinyProxy has continued, therefore we'll also give a preview of upcoming features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>✅</td><td>shiny,automation,docker,webapp                                                                               </td><td>Tobia De Koninck (Open Analytics NV)                                                                                           </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

It is an opportune time to survey the current landscape, as R infrastructure in this respect has matured significantly over recent years. Instead of running a script sequentially from top to bottom, logic that takes a long or unpredictable amount of time to complete may be offloaded to different R processes, possibly on other computers or in the cloud. In the meantime, the main session may be running constantly and non-interactively, performing operations in real time, synchronizing with these tasks only when necessary. This style of programming requires a very specific set of tooling. At the very base, there is an infrastructure layer involving key enabling packages such as later and mirai. It will be explained at a high level why these two packages together currently offer the most complete and efficient implementation of async for the R language. There are further tools which expand async functionality to cover specific needs, such as the watcher package for filesystem monitoring. There are then a range of tools built on top of these, bringing async capabilities to the end-user, such as the httr2 package for querying APIs and the ellmer package for interacting with LLMs. In addition to these existing tools, exciting developments in asynchronous programming are just around the corner. These will be previewed, together with speculation on what might be possible at some point in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>✅</td><td>asynchronous programming, distributed computing, parallel computing, open source tools                       </td><td>Charlie Gao (Posit PBC)                                                                                                        </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

The {box} package modernizes R’s approach to modularization, while {rhino} provides a structured framework for building robust Shiny apps. Together, they offer a structured and scalable workflow for Shiny development. In this talk we will explore how to leverage {box}'s modularity also for API development, using a structured approach to manage routers, endpoints, filters and error handlers. This workflow takes advantage of the programmatic usage of {plumber}, as an alternative for the annotation-based approach. To understand these concepts in a real-world scenario, this talk will present a case study of a Shiny application that integrates {box} for modular design and {plumber} for structured API development. We will walk through key architectural decisions, demonstrate how modularization improves maintainability, and explore how this approach streamlines both Shiny and API development. This will help attendees gain actionable insights they can apply to their own projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>✅</td><td>modules, shiny, box, api, production                                                                         </td><td>Samuel Enrique Calderon Serrano (Appsilon, R Shiny developer)                                                                  </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

As a small, 10-person team formed in 2019 building slow-paced data products with self-imposed goals, such as dashboards, they were hit with difficult tasks to be performed under pressure such as managing information and statistics workflows during a pandemic for a city with 3M inhabitants and serving hundreds of physicians and decision-makers of the public sector with almost real-time information. Over the years, this interdisciplinary team has tripled in size and has played a key role in high-impact strategic data science projects. These include developing data science solutions for extracting information from free-text data, creating complex algorithms for processing data from the city's Electronic Health Records, and implementing large-scale cost recovery initiatives in the healthcare system by cross-referencing massive datasets and generating +35k rendered documents per week shared with key agencies in the city. To fulfill these objectives, the team has built a robust infrastructure and a wide range of digital products—all within the R ecosystem. The talk will cover the strategies, tools, and lessons learned in building efficient and reproducible data workflows in the public sector in a context of very limited resources, and we’ll explore how R has been fundamental in transitioning from individual analyses to scalable, automated workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>✅</td><td>public sector, data science, data mining, workflows, city management                                         </td><td>María Cristina Nanton (University of Buenos Aires)                                                                             </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

Compared to other tools, `pkgdocs` is not focused on generating a static website directly, but rather pages that can be included in a larger documentation site. A common pattern in big projects is to modularize development in several R packages. By just generating markdown and not a finished static site, combining documentation of multiple packages is made easier. `pkgdocs` was made to work well with Hugo and the Docsy theme, but the markdown output should also be usable with other markdown-based static site generators with minor changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>✅</td><td>package, documentation, markdown, stateic site generator                                                     </td><td>Daan Seynaeve                                                                                                                  </td><td>Anne-Katrin Hess                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

Designed for developers, educators, and students, rosella makes model decisions more accessible and interpretable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>✅</td><td>high dimensional data, explainable ai, interactive tools, machine learning                                   </td><td>Janith Wanniarachchi (Monash University)                                                                                       </td><td>Dianne Cook (Monash University); Kate Saunders (Monash University); Patricia Menendez (University of Melbourne); Thiyanga Talagala (University of Sri Jayewardenepura)</td></tr>\n",

The georeferenced survey data can contain either latitude and longitude geocoordinates, or an administrative identifier with a corresponding shapefile. The procedure involves: Downloading geospatial indicator data, Shapefile tessellation, Computing Zonal statistics, and spatial joining of geospatial data with unit level data. The package, for example, can be used to link household characteristics measured in surveys with satellite-derived measures such as the average radiance of night-time light. The package can also calculate indicator values for each pixel covered by a tessellated grid in which a household is located. Finally, the package can be used to calculate zonal statistics for a user-defined shapefile (at native resolution or tessellated) and link the results to survey data. GeoLink complements the povmap and EMDI R packages to facilitate small area estimation with geospatial indicators. The latter two packages enable the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation methods and includes tools for processing, assessing, and presenting the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>✅</td><td>social statistics, geospatial indicator, administrative unit, household survey, poverty mapping              </td><td>Christopher Lloyd (University of Southampton (WorldPop))                                                                       </td><td>Luciano Perfetti-Villa (University of Southampton (School of Geography and Environmental Science))                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

This presentation explores using machine learning algorithms to forecast demand in dermatological clinics and developing an interactive visualization platform using ggplot2 in R. The goal is to help clinics in India and beyond optimize operations, improve patient satisfaction, and enhance resource allocation. Methods: We employ machine learning algorithms, including time series analysis and regression models, to analyze historical patient data. These algorithms identify trends and seasonal variations, enabling accurate demand forecasting. Additionally, we develop an interactive visualization platform using ggplot2 in R. This platform provides intuitive visualizations of clinic data, such as the busiest days, main types of cases, and other critical metrics. It also includes scenario testing features to simulate various staffing and resource allocation strategies. Results: The machine learning models successfully predict demand patterns, allowing clinics to anticipate busy periods and allocate resources effectively. The ggplot2-based visualization platform offers dynamic and customizable charts, making it easy for dermatologists to understand their clinic's data. The scenario testing feature enables clinics to visualize the impact of different staffing and resource allocation strategies, facilitating data-driven decision-making. Conclusion: Combining machine learning forecasts with interactive visualizations empowers dermatological clinics to enhance efficiency, improve patient care, and manage resources effectively. This holistic approach ensures that clinics are well-prepared to meet patient demand, optimize operations, and deliver superior care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>✅</td><td>data visualisation, demand forecasting, data visualisation, ai in health, increasing patient involvement     </td><td>Anjali Ancy                                                                                                                    </td><td>Subitchan .

We are going to explore a few of them, showing how they are used normally and how they are not intended to be used, in a style borrowing from [Wat by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat): - Some S3 classes store functions inside the objects and call them from their own methods, akin to having a virtual method table in C++. By changing the stored function, we can make `print(x)` perform arbitrary actions. - Source references are attributes that link executable objects to their source code. An invalid source reference will obscure the real source code of a function, making it look as if it does something different. - Use of lazy evaluation and dynamic bindings can make variable access execute code. - In addition to the normal evaluator that interprets the `LANGSXP` syntax trees, R contains a bytecode evaluator, which is faster. If the bytecode and the normal body of a function disagree in important ways, the results can be very baffling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>✅</td><td>serialization, evaluation                                                                                    </td><td>Ivan Krylov (Lomonosov Moscow State University)                                                                                </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

This presentation explores how the Data Science Consulting Program at North Carolina State University has developed a question-based framework for R programming consultations that transforms how researchers approach data analysis problems. We'll share our structured consultation methodology that helps patrons clarify research objectives, challenge underlying assumptions, and refine analytical approaches before writing a single line of code. Through case studies spanning multiple academic disciplines, we'll demonstrate how strategic questioning fueled by critical thinking has led researchers to revise their analytical strategies, discover more elegant solutions, and sometimes completely reframe their research questions—ultimately producing more robust and meaningful results. This talk will provide practical insights for anyone supporting R users across skill levels, including a typology of questions that promote deeper analytical thinking, strategies for training consultation staff in this approach, and assessment methods to measure success. Whether you're supporting colleagues in industry, mentoring students, teaching workshops, or building a consultation program, you'll learn skills to learn someone’s real versus stated need and communicate technical information back effectively. Join us to explore how the art of asking the right questions can transform technical consultations and position R experts as valuable contributors to the entire research process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>✅</td><td>consulting, research, critical thinking                                                                                             </td><td>Abhinandra Singh (North Carolina State University)                                            </td><td>Selene Schmittling (North Carolina State University); Alp Tezbasaran (North Carolina State University); Shannon Ricci (North Carolina State University); Mara Blake (North Carolina State University)</td></tr>\n",

By processing terabytes of global vessel position data transmitted via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and applying machine learning models, we create the most comprehensive view of vessel activities around the world. Our datasets are open to everyone and our aim is to facilitate the access to them to the general scientific community. As part of this goal, we created `gfwr`, an R package that communicates with our public APIs and retrieves our data through three main functions: - `get_vessel_info()` provides access to vessel information from hundreds of thousands of fishing and non-fishing vessels from all over the world, getting identity information based on AIS self-reported data, public registries and authorizations - `get_event()` retrieves event information calculated by our algorithms. This includes encounters at sea, loitering, port visits and fishing events by vessel. - `get_raster()` returns fishing effort based on AIS data. In the package documentation, we created vignettes that show how to concatenate these functions into comprehensive workflows that can be adapted depending on the researcher's needs. By offering access through R, we also contribute to more open, transparent and reproducible science. Since 2022, more than 400 users have used `gfwr`, mostly from institutions in North America and Europe. We are now conducting multilingual training workshops to expand this user base and help promote a culture of transparency in ocean governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>✅</td><td>apis, fisheries science, public data, r package, machine learning                                                                   </td><td>Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (Global Fishing Watch)                                                   </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

However, as risk scores continue to evolve and update themselves, it can be a tedious process to recalculate the risk score of many patients as these online portal could only do so one patient at a time. As such, there has been a rise of R package dedicated to calculating a patient's risk of having cardiovascular diseases such as [CVrisk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVrisk/index.html), [RiskScorescvd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RiskScorescvd/index.html) and [whoishRisk](https://github.com/DylanRJCollins/whoishRisk) in an automated way. Despite the progress made, pretest risk scores for obstructive CAD is lacking. Hence an R package called [pretestcad](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/pretestcad) was made to fill this gap, allowing users to calculate these scores automatically for many patients. Examples of such scores are the 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) PTP scores, 2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score and the 2020 Winther et. al. Risk-Factor-weighted Clinical Likelihood (RF-CL) and Coronary Artery Calcium Score-Weighted Clinical Likelihood (CACS-CL) PTP which was recommended to be used in the [2024 ESC Guidelines](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/45/36/3415/7743115). I hope that presenting this R package in this conference could not only raise awareness of the package in the medical field but also collaboration to make the R package more accessible and user friendly and to expand my knowledge of other pretest scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>✅</td><td>pretest probability, risk scores, r package, clinical/medical research                                                              </td><td>Jeremy Selva (National Heart Centre Singapore)                                                </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Even when treatment assignment is ignorable under the study design, the parametric structure necessary for consistent effect estimation limits the gains in precision one seeks by including covariates. In contrast, differencing estimators take the difference between treated and control individuals in their average difference between outcome and some proxy for confounding effects. The propertee package offers users the opportunity to use a prediction of the outcome under control from a flexible “first-stage” model fit as this proxy. The Neyman variance estimator, the default standard error for difference-in-means estimates, fails to account for sampling variability from the model predictions when applied to this ITT effect estimator. The propertee package addresses this issue by augmenting a novel cluster-robust jackknife estimate of the sampling variability of the difference-in-means with a heteroskedasticity-robust estimate of the variability of the model coefficient estimates. This standard error provides asymptotically valid inference for the ITT effect when the first-stage model dimension grows sufficiently slowly with the size of the fitting sample, while entirely removing downward bias in finite samples, even when the model dimension grows more quickly than the rate necessary for asymptotic unbiasedness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>✅</td><td>cluster-randomized trials, clustered observational studies, cluster-robust standard errors, causal inference, intent-to-treat effect</td><td>Joshua Wasserman (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor)                                         </td><td>Ben Hansen (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor)                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

However, existing solutions often suffer from complexity, excessive dependencies, or rigid formatting systems. In response to these challenges, we introduce tinytable, a lightweight yet powerful R package for producing high-quality tables in multiple formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Word, PDF, PNG, Markdown, and Typst. tinytable is designed with a minimalist and intuitive interface while providing extensive customization options. Unlike many existing table-drawing packages, tinytable adheres to a strict design philosophy centered on three principles: separation of data and style, flexibility, and lightweight implementation. First, tinytable ensures that table content remains distinct from formatting instructions, enabling users to generate clean, human-readable code that is easier to edit and debug. Second, the package leverages well-established frameworks such as Bootstrap for HTML and tabularray for LaTeX, providing robust and highly customizable styling capabilities. Third, tinytable prioritizes a lightweight implementation by importing zero third-party R packages by default, reducing computational overhead and improving maintainability. The package was developed to address key limitations observed in existing table-drawing tools, specifically aiming for a simple, flexible, concise, and safe user experience. tinytable provides a streamlined API with a minimal learning curve, allowing users to generate high-quality tables with less code while ensuring strong input validation and informative error messages. Its small and maintainable codebase avoids excessive reliance on regular expressions, making it both efficient and transparent.

Using a series of linked regressions, this analysis quantifies how complementary data relate to one another and respond to treatments. Despite these advances, existing software’s rigid assumptions often result in users viewing mediation analysis as a black box. We designed the multimedia R package to make advanced mediation analysis techniques accessible, ensuring that statistical components are interpretable and adaptable. The package provides a uniform interface to direct and indirect effect estimation, synthetic null hypothesis testing, bootstrap confidence interval construction, and sensitivity analysis, enabling experimentation with various mediator and outcome models while maintaining a simple overall workflow. The software includes modules for regularized linear, compositional, random forest, hierarchical, and hurdle modeling, making it well-suited to microbiome data. We illustrate the package through two case studies. The first re-analyzes a study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, uncovering potential mechanistic interactions between the microbiome and disease-associated metabolites, not found in the original study. The second analyzes new data about the influence of mindfulness practice on the microbiome.

It helps avoid invalid conclusions based on false assumptions. For example, the p-value associated with a coefficient in a linear model is unreliable if the mean function being used does not agree sufficiently with the data. Until now, there has been no easy and reliable way in R to test formally whether or not the mean function of a parametric regression model agrees with the data. In my presentation, I shall discuss my new R package, distfreereg, that implements the distribution-free goodness-of-fit testing procedure for parametric regression models introduced by Estate Khmaladze in 2021. I shall outline Khmaladze's algorithm, discuss the main features of the package, and illustrate its use with examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>❌</td><td>goodness-of-fit testing, parametric regression, regression modeling, empirical partial sum process, r package                       </td><td>Jesse Miller (University of Minnesota)                                                        </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Our primary tools for reporting and visualization since 2012 have been open source versions of R, R-Studio Server and Shiny Server. In the summer of 2022, we committed to installing Posit® Team in order to simplify package management, collaborative development and report publication. Initially, SPG expected all components of Posit® Team to be operational within six months. The actual time was closer to two and a half years. We struggled with strict corporate IT protocols, missed deadlines, service provider selections and legal issues. In hind sight, six months was an unreasonable expectation, but the actual waiting period could have been shortened dramatically had we prepared properly. The purpose of this presentation is to shed light on some of SPG’s roadblocks to implementation and possibly help other small data science groups implement Posit® Team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>✅</td><td>posit team, collaboration, workflow                                                                                                 </td><td>Lowell Gould (Smithfield Foods)                                                               </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

For our project, this transition was driven by the need for a more cost-effective software tool and to reduce dependency on proprietary software services. However, this transition can present challenges such as training for team members, balancing training with other work commitments, and quality assurance for new programs. We describe the transition to R and RStudio over a 3-month period on a public health project with a team that had varying levels of R programming experience. Included in this discussion is our approach to training and implementation, and results for the project transition as we convert programs focused on data quality checks, data manipulation and processing, and statistical estimation. We touch on lessons learned on how to train new programmers to use R, what worked and did not work in terms of converting existing code, and resource planning needed to further continue this transition across other projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>✅</td><td>training, implementation, public health, open-source, transititon                                                                   </td><td>Carlos Petzold (RTI International)                                                            </td><td>Adam Lee (RTI International)                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

What started as a proof of concept a few years ago, evolved into Conti’s first-ever Predictive Machine Learning Model for R&amp;D! A wedding, two babies, three lateral moves, and four hires later, our team had also evolved… from mostly R to mostly Python developers. Rewriting 1000+ commits? No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms. The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td>✅</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>multi-lingual, r, python, docker, mlops                                                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Claudia Penaloza (Continental Tires)                                                          </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </span></td></tr>\n",

Months later I realized I was witnessing the October 2023 annular solar eclipse. So I began to wonder: How many other eclipse events have I been missing? Broad Topics Covered ==================== Julius Caesar vs Pope Gregory XIII: The Battle for Space-Time ------------------------------------------------------------ While most of the western world adopted the Gregorian calendar (365.2425 days long) by the 20th century for agricultural and cultural reasons, astronomers track time off-earth using the older Julian calendar (365.25 days long). We will briefly touch on why this is, how to convert back-and-forth between Gregorian and Julian to perform astronomical calculations, and other notable phenomena to keep in mind when using R in space. User Input: Flexibility vs Ease-of-Use ====================================== Specifically with regards to earthly longitude/latitude coordinate inputs (required for calculating the alignment of celestial bodies to a Earth-bound viewer), a decision had to be made affecting usability of the shiny app for the end-user based on their ability to easily enter an input location: The Breadth of the swephR Package ================================= The swephR package is useful for calculating not only solar and lunar eclipse events visible from earth but all kids of celestial alignments including: - Planetary positions - The crossing of planets over positions - Fixed star positions - Orbital periods for the Earth, asteroids, etc Biography --------- Tim Bender, Hobbyist Bachelor of Urban Planning from the University of Cincinnati. ~15 years local government experience as an urban planner and transit planner. Tim was part of a team that helped deploy Google Transit for his transit agency in Kentucky in 2008, being among the first 50-ish agencies worldwide to go live. Journey with R began with a desire to log transit vehicle real-time location data from an API for analysis but I had no programming experience or knowledge of how to approach the problem. I wouldn’t successfully solve this problem until after about 5 years of self-guided learning.

This push is a relief for many data-science-minded paleontologists who have previously toiled over writing their own scripts to download, clean, analyze, and visualize their data. Many of these steps are now covered by functions in these new packages (and those of other packages in the R universe). However, this push for more script-based research may introduce a wrench in the existing scientific workflows of less technical researchers who lack a background in coding or cause a greater learning curve for new researchers introduced to the field. Therefore, bridging the gap between visual, hands-on workflows and digital, code-based workflows is imperative to the collaborative future of computational paleontology. Here I present a new Shiny app, paleopal, that provides a user-friendly interface to build paleontological data science workflows. The app connects existing paleontological R packages such as palaeoverse and deeptime with the tidyverse suite of R package to encourage standardized scientific pipelines. Furthermore, the app uses the shinymeta R package to provide a live code and results panel and a downloadable RMarkdown script for the pipeline. Altogether, paleopal aims to spearhead the next generation of training of computational paleontologists, regardless of age, background, or technical expertise. Further, the modular nature of the app introduces an avenue for other fields to fork and adapt the project for their own needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>✅</td><td>shiny, workflow, earth sciences, biological sciences, reproducible research                                                         </td><td>William Gearty (Syracuse University)                                                          </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

This ease of use extends to creating Quarto extensions as well. In this talk, we will document the details and process we took to create our Quarto extension, Flourish. Flourish allows users to dynamically target text in code chunks, like functions or parameters, and apply styling (e.g. highlighting) in the rendered document. If you are familiar with the R package Flair, Flourish works similarly, but is language agnostic. We will speak in depth about how Flourish dynamically injects styling into a rendered report using Javascript, and the work it took to get to this process. This talk seeks to inform participants of our extension and its technical workings, as well as step them through our process of creating a Quarto extension, showing how simple it can be to extend Quarto’s functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>✅</td><td>quarto, extension development, pedagogy, formatting, technical                                                                      </td><td>Visruth Srimath Kandali (Cal Poly -- San Luis Obispo)                                         </td><td>Kelly Bodwin (California Polytechnic State University)                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

While a tool may appear promising and seem like the perfect fit for a specific task, early-stage technologies often come with their own set of hurdles. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of comprehensive resources—such as detailed documentation, practical examples, active discussion boards, and community support—which can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues or fully understand the tool’s capabilities. This often requires additional effort, experimentation, and problem-solving to get things working as intended. At last year’s Posit Conference, I was introduced to a new tool called closeread, a Quarto extension designed for vertical scrollytelling. The concept immediately caught my interest because it seemed like an innovative way to enhance storytelling with data. Motivated by its potential, I decided to give it a try shortly after the conference. However, my initial experience was challenging. The tool was only partially functional, and when I encountered technical issues, I struggled to find enough supporting resources to resolve them. The available documentation was limited, examples were scarce, and there wasn’t much discussion happening in community forums. Frustrated by these obstacles, I eventually set the tool aside, unsure of how to move forward. Some time later, I came across a user-contribution contest that reignited my interest in closeread. This contest motivated me to tackle the tool again, but this time with a different mindset. Instead of relying solely on available resources, I approached the problem more systematically—digging into the code, experimenting with different configurations, and learning through trial and error. This hands-on approach, combined with the fresh motivation from the contest, helped me overcome the technical challenges I had faced earlier. Eventually, I was able to get the tool working successfully, and in the process, I gained a deeper understanding of how to navigate the common pitfalls associated with adopting new technology. In my talk, I will share this learning journey in detail, highlighting the strategies that helped me move from frustration to success. I’ll discuss practical approaches for overcoming deployment challenges, including how to troubleshoot effectively when documentation is limited, how to leverage community resources even when they seem sparse, and how to maintain motivation when progress feels slow. I’ll also offer insights into the mindset shifts that can make a big difference—like viewing challenges as opportunities to deepen your technical skills rather than as roadblocks.</td><td>✅</td><td>quarto, closeread, best practices, community, scrollytelling                                                                        </td><td>Dror Berel                                                                                    </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

I discuss how to weave R-code into lectures, embed reproducible visualizations and animations, and easily host data sets as well as downloadable R scripts on a public course website developed with Quarto. I showcase an undergraduate Bayesian statistics course taught at Duke University in Spring 2025 as an example of reproducible statistics pedagogy and provide tutorial-like instructions to adapt the methods to other courses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>✅</td><td>teaching, statistics, website, reproducible                                                                                         </td><td>Alexander Fisher (Duke University)                                                            </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

They run on every save, on every pull request, and in git pre-commit hooks to ensure code consistently looks its best at all times. In this talk, you'll learn about Air, a new R code formatter. Air is extremely fast, capable of formatting individual files so fast that you'll question if its even running, and of formatting entire projects in under a second. Air integrates directly with your favorite IDEs, like Positron, RStudio, and VS Code, and is available on the command line, making it easy to standardize on one tool even for teams using various IDEs. Once you start using Air, you'll never worry about code style ever again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>✅</td><td>formatter, rust                                                                                                                     </td><td>Lionel Henry (Posit PBC); Davis Vaughan (Posit PBC)                                           </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Although various tools exist to simplify the process, they often focus exclusively on R package dependencies and omit the system ones, rely on user-supplied metadata, or create an unnecessarily large environment. We present `r4r`, a tool that automatically traces all dependencies in a pipeline using system call interception. Based on these traces, `r4r` generates a Docker image containing precisely the dependencies needed for reproducible execution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a collection of R Markdown notebooks from Kaggle, illustrating how `r4r` helps ensure fully reproducible workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>✅</td><td>reproducibility, docker, automation                                                                                                 </td><td>Pierre Donat-Bouillud (Czech Technical University); Filip Křikava (Czech Technical University)</td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

The wizrd package was born for testing the hypothesis that LLMs can be used to implement functions within larger data science tools and workflows. With wizrd, users can parameterize model inputs, implement logic that delegates to R functions, and constrain outputs to specific R data structures. Finally, configured models can be converted into actual R functions, which can in turn serve as tools for other models, forming a graph of agents. LLM-based programs can be imported from the Langsmith hub, realizing their portability across languages. We will give an overview and demo of the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>✅</td><td>llm, ai, programming                                                                                                                </td><td>Michael Lawrence                                                                              </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Any user with R installed can contribute their compute power when idle and harness others when needed. # Abstract The Futureverse framework revolutionized parallel computing in R by providing a simple, unified API for parallel evaluation of R code. At its core, the future package allows developers to write code once (e.g. `f &lt;- future(lm(x, y))`), which then may be evaluated on any future-compatible parallel backend. For instance, `plan(multisession)` parallelizes on the local machine, `plan(cluster)` and `plan(mirai_cluster)` can parallelize on a set of local or remote machines, and `plan(batchtools_slurm)` distributes the computations on a Slurm high-performance compute (HPC) cluster, and so on. Regardless of backend used, getting the value of the future is always the same (e.g. `v &lt;- value(f)`). In this presentation, I introduce a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) future backend that enables distributed parallel computing among friends and colleagues using shared storage. The shared storage can be a local file system or a cloud storage. I will illustrate this concept using the `plan(p2p_gdrive)` backend, which leverages Google Drive as a communication medium, where users can offload computational tasks to peers in a shared workspace. When a user creates a future, it ends up in the “todo” folder, where idle peers can detect it, download it, and execute it locally. Once completed, the result is uploaded to the “done” folder, making them available for retrieval by the original user. The Futureverse ecosystem has a simple API, which makes it is easy for anyone to write parallel R code. Because Futureverse is exceedingly well-tested, you can easily and safely scale up code currently running on your local computer to run on distributed P2P clusters. This approach democratizes distributed computing, allowing R users to harness the collective power of their social network without requiring dedicated HPC infrastructure. Come to my talk and learn how you and your friends can get together and share your compute resources, allowing you to run `y &lt;- future_lapply(X, my_long_running_analysis)` across their computers, while you share your idle compute resources with them. All this is available from your local R prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                       </span></td><td>✅</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>programming, parallel processing, performance, reproducibility                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Henrik Bengtsson (University of California San Francisco (UCSF))                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </span></td></tr>\n",

An R user may find their laptop more than sufficient to start their journey with statistical computing, but as datasets grow in size and complexity, so does the necessity for more sophisticated tooling. This talk will step through a set of approaches to scale your tasks beyond in-memory analysis on your local machine, using the Postron IDE: adopting a lazy evaluation engine like DuckDB, connecting to remote databases with fluent workflows, and even migrating from desktop analysis entirely to server or cloud compute using SSH tunnelling. The transition away from a local, in-memory programming paradigm can be challenging for R users, who may not have much exposure to tools or training for these ways of working. This talk will explore available options which make crossing this boundary more approachable, and how they can be used with an advanced development environment suited for statistical computing with R. Integrations in the Positron IDE make all these tasks easier; for example, remote development in Positron allows an R user to seamlessly write code on their local machine, and execute that code on a remote host without tedious interactions outside the IDE. Whether you train statistical models, build interactive apps, or work with large datasets, after this talk you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>✅</td><td>ide, workflow, tooling, remote development                                                                                          </td><td>Julia Silge (Posit PBC)                                                                       </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

However, modern tooling, including Parquet files, the Arrow format, and query engines like DuckDB, can expand what is possible to do with large datasets in R. Using practical examples, this talk will introduce several packages that bring these tools into R with intuitive interfaces, and demonstrate how to adopt them to work efficiently with large datasets. It will also show how these tools unlock new opportunities, such as easy access to data in cloud storage, and will explore recent developments in the Arrow and Parquet ecosystems, including for geospatial data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>✅</td><td>arrow, parquet, duckdb, big data                                                                                                    </td><td>Neal Richardson (Posit PBC)                                                                   </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

However, existing data structures such as data.frames or matrices doesn't have a good way of controlling them. You were forced to represent all data as sparse or dense (non-sparse).

It has been available for beta testing for a number of months, and R users may have wondered if they should try it or if it will be a good fit for them. This new IDE is an extensible tool built to facilitate exploratory data analysis, reproducible authoring, and publishing data artifacts, and it is an IDE that supports but is not built only for R. How should an R user think about Positron, compared to the other options out there? In this talk, learn about how and why Positron is designed the way it is, what will feel familiar or new coming from other IDEs such as RStudio, and when (or if) people who use R should consider giving it a try. You’ll hear about different choices when it comes to defaults and ways of working, such as how to think about your projects or folders and how to manage multiple versions of R. You will also learn about new functionality for R users and package developers that we have never had before, like new approaches for managing R package tests and the ability to customize an IDE using extensions. If you are curious about Positron and how it fits into the R ecosystem, you’ll come away from this talk with more details about its capabilities and more clarity about whether it may be a good choice for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & ✅ & ide, workflow, tooling                                                                                        & Julia Silge (Posit PBC)                                                                                                         & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can use plumber, an R package for building APIs, to create a webhook listener that triggers your workflows such as updating dashboards, triggering machine learning retraining, and other potential use cases. In the presentation, I will cover how to process payloads - using GitHub webhooks as an example, verifying authenticity using HMAC signatures, and implementing logging for tracking script execution, debugging, and monitoring. This talk will benefit researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to make their R workflows responsive to certain triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & ✅ & automation, event-driven workflows, plumber api, github webhooks                                              & CLINTON DAVID                                                                                                                   & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

Traditional measurement methods often fall short, leaving marketers with more questions than answers: Is TV a dead channel? Is last-click attribution selling your brand-building efforts short? Are you overinvesting in one channel while under-utilising another? In this talk, we will take you beyond surface-level metrics and into the world of econometrics in R: the gold standard for understanding marketing effectiveness. By applying time-series regression techniques, we can move past vanity metrics and gut feelings to uncover the real impact of marketing spend. Attribution is one of the biggest debates in marketing measurement, therefore, this talk will also explore whether first-click, last-click, or equal weightings really make sense - or whether a more nuanced approach is needed to reflect consumer behaviour. Next, we’ll explore how to quantify return on investment with rigor, determine the optimal allocation of budget across channels, visualise the relationship between channels, and understand diminishing returns to avoid wasted spend. All while breaking down key marketing acronyms, campaign types, and measurement approaches to ensure you leave with a clear understanding of how to apply these concepts in the real world. Finally, we will demonstrate our award-winning (IPA, 2024) example case study built in R with December19 Media Agency, for Xero Accounting UK, to bring our time-series regression analyses to life.

CSV format is advantageous for its simplicity. When the data size is small, it is easy to inspect the CSV data using a spreadsheet program. However, CSV files tend to become very slow for read and write operations at larger data sizes. Enter Apache Parquet > Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming language and analytics tools. From Apache Parquet Documentation The talk would focus on an overview of the Apache Parquet format and advantages compared to the CSV format. I would also demonstrate reading and writing data in this format in R and show the interoperability with Apache Arrow. Further, I would demonstrate how this format would make life easier for polyglot teams that use R and Python. Finally, the session would end by mentioning key points to consider to decide their storage format. The participants would get introduced to Apache Parquet and Arrow and be able to better decide storage format for their workflows. Broad Agenda 1. Overview of the Apache Parquet format 2.

While there are good guidelines on how to report the results, data visualization tools are rarely used in understanding the results of EFA. Good data visualization, especially in a multivariate framework with ordinal data, makes it easier for people interpret the results of the analysis better. This presentation introduces and demonstrates different data visualization techniques that can be used to illustrate the results of EFA and improve its interpretation. Advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques are discussed. As EFA is oftentimes used on categorical data from survey research, apart from visualizations for the factor results, exploratory data visualization for categorical variables are also presented. Moreover, these graphical tools can be used for purposes other than EFA. Data visualization and analysis is performed in R using publicly available survey research data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & ✅ & factor analysis, exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction, ordinal data, survey research                & Nivedita Bhaktha (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur)                                                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

Ensuring that code works correctly with unit-testing is well-established in R, but validating that we write the correct code—aligned with user needs—remains a challenge. In this talk, we’ll explore how Behavior-Driven Development helps collaborating with stakeholders by translating their needs into automated tests that check if our software satisfies them. You’ll walk away with an understanding of how to start practicing BDD in R with \\{cucumber\\}: a method of producing tests that describe what your software does, and makes tests easier to maintain as your software evolves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & ✅ & testing, behavior-driven development, test-driven development, efficient programming, gherkin                 & Jakub Sobolewski                                                                                                                & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

This pipeline was instrumental in allowing the review and use of 2.2 billion rows/175 GB of source data. During the process of developing the sepsis criteria, we received multiple new data deliveries from each site, which required frequent review and re-harmonization of the provided source datasets. This harmonization pipeline consisted of multiple steps including conflating multiple source rows types to one harmonized type, performing source specific unit mapping, and performing value transformations. In an iterative process, clinical experts would identify rows for mapping, data scientists would run the harmonization pipeline, and then clinical experts would review mapped data using Shiny tools custom built for this project. Due to project and dataset size, we leveraged a range of tools including Google BigQuery, R, and make. After harmonization, the cleaned dataset was approximately 1.7 billion rows/155GB in size. This large amount of data required special considerations to perform acceptably. To keep Shiny responsive, to keep the server hosting our Shiny apps from crashing, and to prevent client browser crashes, we had to limit data being reviewed to at most a random sample of 50\\% of the larger data groupings. !{[}Application Screenshot{]}{[}1{]} {[}1{]}: https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/9376248/421070526-1ced6919-a0f8-4dac-9561-afb442c48161.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3NDE2MzcyODksIm5iZiI6MTc0MTYzNjk4OSwicGF0aCI6Ii85Mzc2MjQ4LzQyMTA3MDUyNi0xY2VkNjkxOS1hMGY4LTRkYWMtOTU2MS1hZmI0NDJjNDgxNjEucG5nP1gtQW16LUFsZ29yaXRobT1BV1M0LUhNQUMtU0hBMjU2JlgtQW16LUNyZWRlbnRpYWw9QUtJQVZDT0RZTFNBNTNQUUs0WkElMkYyMDI1MDMxMCUyRnVzLWVhc3QtMSUyRnMzJTJGYXdzNF9yZXF1ZXN0JlgtQW16LURhdGU9MjAyNTAzMTBUMjAwMzA5WiZYLUFtei1FeHBpcmVzPTMwMCZYLUFtei1TaWduYXR1cmU9ZWZlZmE2YTNmZjY4MzBiYThiYjkxYTljMjI3NmVmYmI5NDIwM2IxOTE4NjM2M2IwODExOGEwZWYwMjgyODgwYiZYLUFtei1TaWduZWRIZWFkZXJzPWhvc3QifQ.zYshCSHQCOw9AKIrUIEb15KvmI2lqsls0s-wjxhxE2E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & ✅ & big data, shiny, healthcare, data harmonization, rdbms                                                        & Seth Russell (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)                                                                   & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",
       "\t 145 & Virtual           & 2025-08-01 & TBD & Online & Intracranial Pressure Monitor Placement Prediction in Children with Traumatic Brain Injury             & Traumatic brain injury causes approximately 2,200 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations in U.S. children annually. Clinicians currently make decisions about placing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor in children with traumatic brain injury without the benefit of an accurate clinical decision support tool. In a prospective observational cohort study, we developed and validated models that predict placement of an ICP monitor. Patient data was gathered from multiple sources and discretized into 5-minute intervals. We divided data into four combinations of nurse documented and chart extracted input data, all including patient level and vital sign variables, and with inclusion or exclusion of data from brain computed tomography imaging reports and invasive blood pressure readings. Using R, we built machine learning models using logistic regression, support vector machines, generalized estimating equations, generalized additive models, and LSTMs. We trained each model with each combination of data. Optimal parameters were identified based on the highest F1. The best performing model, an LSTM deep learning model, achieved an F1 of 0.71 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. The best non-neural network model, standard logistic regression, achieved an F1 of 0.36 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. While non-RNN models did not achieve the best F1, their coefficient size and direction provide insight into factors predicting ICP monitor placement. Additionally, the generalized additive models allow for visualization and interpretation of the marginal impact (after integrating out the impact of the other variables) of a variable over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & ✅ & deep learning, machine learning, healthcare, decision making                                                  & Seth Russell (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)                                                                   & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

It allows to submit packages through a user interface or API and to automatically update and publish R and Python repositories. Multiple departments can manage their own repositories and different users can have different roles in the management of their packages. With continuous integration infrastructure for quality assurance on R and Python packages, package uploads can be automated. All configuration is declarative and RDepot can be set up as infrastructure as code, which is especially relevant in regulated contexts, since it makes validation activities much easier. Packages from publicly available R repositories such as {[}CRAN{]}(https://cran.r-project.org/) and {[}Bioconductor{]}(https://bioconductor.org/packages) can be mirrored selectively in custom repositories for use behind a firewall, in internal networks and offline. Combined with {[}Crane{]}(https://craneserver.net), authentication and fine-grained authorization (using {[}OpenID Connect{]}(https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)) can be configured per repository, which offers extra security when dealing with sensitive data or sensitive methodology. In this talk we will walk R users and developers through different features of RDepot and demonstrate how these can be useful in different scenarios. The logic of the different workflows will be explained and live demos will be given to see the open source solution in action. We will make sure to address needs ranging from small research groups sharing a handful of packages up to multinational companies managing their R (and Python) code across the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & ✅ & package management, infrastructure, open source                                                               & Jonas Van Malder                                                                                                                & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

This is a problem for many data science organizations and can now be solved using a novel open source product Crane (https://craneserver.net/). Crane hosts data science artifacts such as data analysis reports, documentation sites, or even packages and libraries. All of these data science artifacts are kept under strict authentication and authorization using modern protocols (OIDC). In this talk, we walk you through the different features of Crane and provide a live demo to explain the concepts. We will discuss its configuration file and demonstrate that authentication in Crane is fully declarative and allows for fine-grained configuration (at user-level, group-level, network-level or using SpEL) while still using an intuitive hierarchical tree that corresponds to the directory structure of the data. Next, we will show how artifacts can be accessed from or uploaded into Crane using the Crane API from R (e.g. to automate report updates, use data science artifacts in CI/CD) or using its customizable UI. Further, we zoom in on audit logs to track operations on all files (e.g. for GxP purposes) and detail the different storage backends (S3 and local file system). To ensure Crane can perform in high security settings the code base has been tested using integration tests reaching a high code coverage of more than 70\\%. With this talk we want to teach any R user and developer the essentials of Crane and how it can be used to share their data science artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & ✅ & data sharing, data, automation, r, repository managment                                                       & Lucianos Lionakis (Open Analytics)                                                                                              & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

In this talk, we will explore how to take Shiny beyond it’s default appearance to create dashboards that are not only visually appealing but also highly usable, accessible, and seamlessly integrated into an organisation’s digital environment. To demonstrate this to our audience, we will share our open-source dashboard in collaboration with the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). While the project required thorough data integration and analysis, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring the dashboard was not just functional but also visually cohesive, highly accessible, and intuitive for a broad range of users—including policymakers with varying levels of data literacy. We’ll start by discussing how to balance the line between over-simplifying and over-complicating data. Like most open-source data, there is a vast library of data, with little documentation on how to interpret it. Therefore, how to optimise open-source government underpins this talk – to ensure interactivity and efficient rendering techniques, so we can keep dashboards responsive and user-friendly. Next, we will be jump into customisation now that the foundations are in place - looking at how custom CSS and JavaScript can be leveraged to break free from the typical Shiny aesthetic, ensuring dashboards align with existing brand guidelines and user expectations. From typography and colour schemes to interactive elements, we’ll discuss techniques to create a polished, professional design that feels like a natural extension of an organisation’s existing web presence. Accessibility is another key factor in dashboard design. Many users—whether government policymakers, corporate stakeholders, or public audiences—have varying levels of data literacy, and a poorly designed interface can create barriers to insight. We’ll cover strategies for making dashboards more intuitive, including thoughtful navigation structures, tooltips, dynamic summaries, and alternative ways to display data for users with different needs. Additionally, we’ll explore best practices for ensuring compliance with accessibility standards, such as improving contrast, enabling keyboard navigation, and implementing screen reader-friendly elements. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to design Shiny dashboards that are not just functional but genuinely enjoyable to use - helping your audience engage with data more effectively and make better-informed decisions with open-source data. & ✅ & shiny apps, dashboard, environmental science, health science, decision-making, customisation                  & Abbie Brookes; Jeremy Horne (Director @ Datacove)                                                                               & Abbie Brookes                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

Because of it's flexibility, ShinyProxy is being used by both small startups and large enterprises. Although ShinyProxy was originally tailored towards hosting Shiny apps, it can host virtually any web app. Since ShinyProxy makes it easy to make reproducible apps, even when using multiple R versions, it's often used by pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, it's used by financial and engineering companies as well. ShinyProxy seamlessly integrates with your existing infrastructure (such as authentication providers and databases). The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction to ShinyProxy, explain the use-cases of ShinyProxy and it's unique advantages over other solutions. No deep technical knowledge (e.g. of Docker or Linux) is needed to follow this talk, however, the talk will give you enough information to start using ShinyProxy yourselves. As usual, the development of ShinyProxy has continued, therefore we'll also give a preview of upcoming features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & ✅ & shiny,automation,docker,webapp                                                                                & Tobia De Koninck (Open Analytics NV)                                                                                            & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

It is an opportune time to survey the current landscape, as R infrastructure in this respect has matured significantly over recent years. Instead of running a script sequentially from top to bottom, logic that takes a long or unpredictable amount of time to complete may be offloaded to different R processes, possibly on other computers or in the cloud. In the meantime, the main session may be running constantly and non-interactively, performing operations in real time, synchronizing with these tasks only when necessary. This style of programming requires a very specific set of tooling. At the very base, there is an infrastructure layer involving key enabling packages such as later and mirai. It will be explained at a high level why these two packages together currently offer the most complete and efficient implementation of async for the R language. There are further tools which expand async functionality to cover specific needs, such as the watcher package for filesystem monitoring. There are then a range of tools built on top of these, bringing async capabilities to the end-user, such as the httr2 package for querying APIs and the ellmer package for interacting with LLMs. In addition to these existing tools, exciting developments in asynchronous programming are just around the corner. These will be previewed, together with speculation on what might be possible at some point in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & ✅ & asynchronous programming, distributed computing, parallel computing, open source tools                        & Charlie Gao (Posit PBC)                                                                                                         & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

The \\{box\\} package modernizes R’s approach to modularization, while \\{rhino\\} provides a structured framework for building robust Shiny apps. Together, they offer a structured and scalable workflow for Shiny development. In this talk we will explore how to leverage \\{box\\}'s modularity also for API development, using a structured approach to manage routers, endpoints, filters and error handlers. This workflow takes advantage of the programmatic usage of \\{plumber\\}, as an alternative for the annotation-based approach. To understand these concepts in a real-world scenario, this talk will present a case study of a Shiny application that integrates \\{box\\} for modular design and \\{plumber\\} for structured API development. We will walk through key architectural decisions, demonstrate how modularization improves maintainability, and explore how this approach streamlines both Shiny and API development.

As a small, 10-person team formed in 2019 building slow-paced data products with self-imposed goals, such as dashboards, they were hit with difficult tasks to be performed under pressure such as managing information and statistics workflows during a pandemic for a city with 3M inhabitants and serving hundreds of physicians and decision-makers of the public sector with almost real-time information. Over the years, this interdisciplinary team has tripled in size and has played a key role in high-impact strategic data science projects. These include developing data science solutions for extracting information from free-text data, creating complex algorithms for processing data from the city's Electronic Health Records, and implementing large-scale cost recovery initiatives in the healthcare system by cross-referencing massive datasets and generating +35k rendered documents per week shared with key agencies in the city. To fulfill these objectives, the team has built a robust infrastructure and a wide range of digital products—all within the R ecosystem.

By just generating markdown and not a finished static site, combining documentation of multiple packages is made easier. `pkgdocs` was made to work well with Hugo and the Docsy theme, but the markdown output should also be usable with other markdown-based static site generators with minor changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & ✅ & package, documentation, markdown, stateic site generator                                                      & Daan Seynaeve                                                                                                                   & Anne-Katrin Hess                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

Explainable AI (XAI) methods were introduced to provide insights into model predictions, however interpreting these explanations can be difficult without proper visualisation methods. To fill this gap we have built rosella, an R package offering an interactive Shiny app that visualizes model behavior in the data space alongside XAI explanations. Designed for developers, educators, and students, rosella makes model decisions more accessible and interpretable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & ✅ & high dimensional data, explainable ai, interactive tools, machine learning                                    & Janith Wanniarachchi (Monash University)                                                                                        & Dianne Cook (Monash University); Kate Saunders (Monash University); Patricia Menendez (University of Melbourne); Thiyanga Talagala (University of Sri Jayewardenepura)\\\\\n",

Our Shiny-based Collection Dashboard, powered by Gen AI, transforms the way business teams interact with data. The dashboard monitors key metrics like Bounce rate, First EMI Bounce, Current resolution etc., with multi-level filtering by zone, state, region, and branch. To enhance usability, we introduced: - Automated PPT Generation: Users can download a fully customized PowerPoint presentation for any combination of filters. The charts are further enhanced with summaries and actionable items for business by an LLM, providing key takeaways. - \"Talk to Your Data\" (Text2SQL): Business teams can query the data in natural language—e.g., “Which zone had the highest bounce rate this month?”—and receive instant, downloadable reports.

The georeferenced survey data can contain either latitude and longitude geocoordinates, or an administrative identifier with a corresponding shapefile. The procedure involves: Downloading geospatial indicator data, Shapefile tessellation, Computing Zonal statistics, and spatial joining of geospatial data with unit level data. The package, for example, can be used to link household characteristics measured in surveys with satellite-derived measures such as the average radiance of night-time light. The package can also calculate indicator values for each pixel covered by a tessellated grid in which a household is located. Finally, the package can be used to calculate zonal statistics for a user-defined shapefile (at native resolution or tessellated) and link the results to survey data. GeoLink complements the povmap and EMDI R packages to facilitate small area estimation with geospatial indicators. The latter two packages enable the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation methods and includes tools for processing, assessing, and presenting the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & ✅ & social statistics, geospatial indicator, administrative unit, household survey, poverty mapping               & Christopher Lloyd (University of Southampton (WorldPop))                                                                        & Luciano Perfetti-Villa (University of Southampton (School of Geography and Environmental Science))                                                                    \\\\\n",

The broad AI response environment is restricted with specific commands to ensure more controlled outputs. The development of this application utilizes two main packages: shiny and gemini.R. Additionally, several supporting packages, including readxl, ggplot2, olsrr, and reshape2, are used for data import, visualization, and modeling. Finally, the application is deployed using the shinyapps.io platform.

We are going to explore a few of them, showing how they are used normally and how they are not intended to be used, in a style borrowing from {[}Wat by Gary Bernhardt{]}(https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat): - Some S3 classes store functions inside the objects and call them from their own methods, akin to having a virtual method table in C++. By changing the stored function, we can make `print(x)` perform arbitrary actions. - Source references are attributes that link executable objects to their source code. An invalid source reference will obscure the real source code of a function, making it look as if it does something different. - Use of lazy evaluation and dynamic bindings can make variable access execute code. - In addition to the normal evaluator that interprets the `LANGSXP` syntax trees, R contains a bytecode evaluator, which is faster. If the bytecode and the normal body of a function disagree in important ways, the results can be very baffling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & ✅ & serialization, evaluation                                                                                     & Ivan Krylov (Lomonosov Moscow State University)                                                                                 & NA                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

This presentation explores how the Data Science Consulting Program at North Carolina State University has developed a question-based framework for R programming consultations that transforms how researchers approach data analysis problems. We'll share our structured consultation methodology that helps patrons clarify research objectives, challenge underlying assumptions, and refine analytical approaches before writing a single line of code. Through case studies spanning multiple academic disciplines, we'll demonstrate how strategic questioning fueled by critical thinking has led researchers to revise their analytical strategies, discover more elegant solutions, and sometimes completely reframe their research questions—ultimately producing more robust and meaningful results. This talk will provide practical insights for anyone supporting R users across skill levels, including a typology of questions that promote deeper analytical thinking, strategies for training consultation staff in this approach, and assessment methods to measure success. Whether you're supporting colleagues in industry, mentoring students, teaching workshops, or building a consultation program, you'll learn skills to learn someone’s real versus stated need and communicate technical information back effectively. Join us to explore how the art of asking the right questions can transform technical consultations and position R experts as valuable contributors to the entire research process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & ✅ & consulting, research, critical thinking                                                                                              & Abhinandra Singh (North Carolina State University)                                             & Selene Schmittling (North Carolina State University); Alp Tezbasaran (North Carolina State University); Shannon Ricci (North Carolina State University); Mara Blake (North Carolina State University)\\\\\n",

By processing terabytes of global vessel position data transmitted via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and applying machine learning models, we create the most comprehensive view of vessel activities around the world. Our datasets are open to everyone and our aim is to facilitate the access to them to the general scientific community. As part of this goal, we created `gfwr`, an R package that communicates with our public APIs and retrieves our data through three main functions: - `get\\_vessel\\_info()` provides access to vessel information from hundreds of thousands of fishing and non-fishing vessels from all over the world, getting identity information based on AIS self-reported data, public registries and authorizations - `get\\_event()` retrieves event information calculated by our algorithms. This includes encounters at sea, loitering, port visits and fishing events by vessel. - `get\\_raster()` returns fishing effort based on AIS data. In the package documentation, we created vignettes that show how to concatenate these functions into comprehensive workflows that can be adapted depending on the researcher's needs. By offering access through R, we also contribute to more open, transparent and reproducible science. Since 2022, more than 400 users have used `gfwr`, mostly from institutions in North America and Europe. We are now conducting multilingual training workshops to expand this user base and help promote a culture of transparency in ocean governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & ✅ & apis, fisheries science, public data, r package, machine learning                                                                    & Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (Global Fishing Watch)                                                    & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

However, as risk scores continue to evolve and update themselves, it can be a tedious process to recalculate the risk score of many patients as these online portal could only do so one patient at a time. As such, there has been a rise of R package dedicated to calculating a patient's risk of having cardiovascular diseases such as {[}CVrisk{]}(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVrisk/index.html), {[}RiskScorescvd{]}(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RiskScorescvd/index.html) and {[}whoishRisk{]}(https://github.com/DylanRJCollins/whoishRisk) in an automated way. Despite the progress made, pretest risk scores for obstructive CAD is lacking. Hence an R package called {[}pretestcad{]}(https://github.com/JauntyJJS/pretestcad) was made to fill this gap, allowing users to calculate these scores automatically for many patients. Examples of such scores are the 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) PTP scores, 2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score and the 2020 Winther et. al.

Even when treatment assignment is ignorable under the study design, the parametric structure necessary for consistent effect estimation limits the gains in precision one seeks by including covariates. In contrast, differencing estimators take the difference between treated and control individuals in their average difference between outcome and some proxy for confounding effects. The propertee package offers users the opportunity to use a prediction of the outcome under control from a flexible “first-stage” model fit as this proxy. The Neyman variance estimator, the default standard error for difference-in-means estimates, fails to account for sampling variability from the model predictions when applied to this ITT effect estimator. The propertee package addresses this issue by augmenting a novel cluster-robust jackknife estimate of the sampling variability of the difference-in-means with a heteroskedasticity-robust estimate of the variability of the model coefficient estimates. This standard error provides asymptotically valid inference for the ITT effect when the first-stage model dimension grows sufficiently slowly with the size of the fitting sample, while entirely removing downward bias in finite samples, even when the model dimension grows more quickly than the rate necessary for asymptotic unbiasedness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & ✅ & cluster-randomized trials, clustered observational studies, cluster-robust standard errors, causal inference, intent-to-treat effect & Joshua Wasserman (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor)                                          & Ben Hansen (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor)                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

However, existing solutions often suffer from complexity, excessive dependencies, or rigid formatting systems. In response to these challenges, we introduce tinytable, a lightweight yet powerful R package for producing high-quality tables in multiple formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Word, PDF, PNG, Markdown, and Typst. tinytable is designed with a minimalist and intuitive interface while providing extensive customization options. Unlike many existing table-drawing packages, tinytable adheres to a strict design philosophy centered on three principles: separation of data and style, flexibility, and lightweight implementation. First, tinytable ensures that table content remains distinct from formatting instructions, enabling users to generate clean, human-readable code that is easier to edit and debug. Second, the package leverages well-established frameworks such as Bootstrap for HTML and tabularray for LaTeX, providing robust and highly customizable styling capabilities. Third, tinytable prioritizes a lightweight implementation by importing zero third-party R packages by default, reducing computational overhead and improving maintainability. The package was developed to address key limitations observed in existing table-drawing tools, specifically aiming for a simple, flexible, concise, and safe user experience. tinytable provides a streamlined API with a minimal learning curve, allowing users to generate high-quality tables with less code while ensuring strong input validation and informative error messages. Its small and maintainable codebase avoids excessive reliance on regular expressions, making it both efficient and transparent. This presentation will showcase tinytable’s capabilities through applied examples, demonstrating how users can create aesthetically pleasing tables with minimal effort while retaining complete control over their formatting. By offering a zero-dependency, highly customizable, and human-readable approach to table generation, tinytable represents a valuable addition to the R ecosystem for data analysis and reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & ✅ & table formatting, latex, html, markdown, reproducible research                                                                       & Vincent Arel-Bundock (Université de Montréal)                                                  & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

Using a series of linked regressions, this analysis quantifies how complementary data relate to one another and respond to treatments. Despite these advances, existing software’s rigid assumptions often result in users viewing mediation analysis as a black box. We designed the multimedia R package to make advanced mediation analysis techniques accessible, ensuring that statistical components are interpretable and adaptable. The package provides a uniform interface to direct and indirect effect estimation, synthetic null hypothesis testing, bootstrap confidence interval construction, and sensitivity analysis, enabling experimentation with various mediator and outcome models while maintaining a simple overall workflow. The software includes modules for regularized linear, compositional, random forest, hierarchical, and hurdle modeling, making it well-suited to microbiome data. We illustrate the package through two case studies. The first re-analyzes a study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, uncovering potential mechanistic interactions between the microbiome and disease-associated metabolites, not found in the original study. The second analyzes new data about the influence of mindfulness practice on the microbiome.

It helps avoid invalid conclusions based on false assumptions. For example, the p-value associated with a coefficient in a linear model is unreliable if the mean function being used does not agree sufficiently with the data. Until now, there has been no easy and reliable way in R to test formally whether or not the mean function of a parametric regression model agrees with the data. In my presentation, I shall discuss my new R package, distfreereg, that implements the distribution-free goodness-of-fit testing procedure for parametric regression models introduced by Estate Khmaladze in 2021. I shall outline Khmaladze's algorithm, discuss the main features of the package, and illustrate its use with examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & ❌ & goodness-of-fit testing, parametric regression, regression modeling, empirical partial sum process, r package                        & Jesse Miller (University of Minnesota)                                                         & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

Our primary tools for reporting and visualization since 2012 have been open source versions of R, R-Studio Server and Shiny Server. In the summer of 2022, we committed to installing Posit® Team in order to simplify package management, collaborative development and report publication. Initially, SPG expected all components of Posit® Team to be operational within six months. The actual time was closer to two and a half years. We struggled with strict corporate IT protocols, missed deadlines, service provider selections and legal issues. In hind sight, six months was an unreasonable expectation, but the actual waiting period could have been shortened dramatically had we prepared properly. The purpose of this presentation is to shed light on some of SPG’s roadblocks to implementation and possibly help other small data science groups implement Posit® Team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & ✅ & posit team, collaboration, workflow                                                                                                  & Lowell Gould (Smithfield Foods)                                                                & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

For our project, this transition was driven by the need for a more cost-effective software tool and to reduce dependency on proprietary software services. However, this transition can present challenges such as training for team members, balancing training with other work commitments, and quality assurance for new programs. We describe the transition to R and RStudio over a 3-month period on a public health project with a team that had varying levels of R programming experience. Included in this discussion is our approach to training and implementation, and results for the project transition as we convert programs focused on data quality checks, data manipulation and processing, and statistical estimation. We touch on lessons learned on how to train new programmers to use R, what worked and did not work in terms of converting existing code, and resource planning needed to further continue this transition across other projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & ✅ & training, implementation, public health, open-source, transititon                                                                    & Carlos Petzold (RTI International)                                                             & Adam Lee (RTI International)                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

What started as a proof of concept a few years ago, evolved into Conti’s first-ever Predictive Machine Learning Model for R\\&D! A wedding, two babies, three lateral moves, and four hires later, our team had also evolved… from mostly R to mostly Python developers. Rewriting 1000+ commits? No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms. The takeaway?

Months later I realized I was witnessing the October 2023 annular solar eclipse. So I began to wonder: How many other eclipse events have I been missing? Broad Topics Covered ==================== Julius Caesar vs Pope Gregory XIII: The Battle for Space-Time ------------------------------------------------------------ While most of the western world adopted the Gregorian calendar (365.2425 days long) by the 20th century for agricultural and cultural reasons, astronomers track time off-earth using the older Julian calendar (365.25 days long). We will briefly touch on why this is, how to convert back-and-forth between Gregorian and Julian to perform astronomical calculations, and other notable phenomena to keep in mind when using R in space.

This talk proposes new ways to extend existing Shiny dashboards to mobile dashboards by using Ionic and JavaScript, while making use of a Rust server for data manipulation and preparation. We'll analyze the integration of Shiny with a mobile frontend Shiny, the benefits offered by Rust in terms of backend efficiency, and the tradeoffs offered between web-based and mobile dashboard interfaces.

This push is a relief for many data-science-minded paleontologists who have previously toiled over writing their own scripts to download, clean, analyze, and visualize their data. Many of these steps are now covered by functions in these new packages (and those of other packages in the R universe). However, this push for more script-based research may introduce a wrench in the existing scientific workflows of less technical researchers who lack a background in coding or cause a greater learning curve for new researchers introduced to the field. Therefore, bridging the gap between visual, hands-on workflows and digital, code-based workflows is imperative to the collaborative future of computational paleontology. Here I present a new Shiny app, paleopal, that provides a user-friendly interface to build paleontological data science workflows. The app connects existing paleontological R packages such as palaeoverse and deeptime with the tidyverse suite of R package to encourage standardized scientific pipelines. Furthermore, the app uses the shinymeta R package to provide a live code and results panel and a downloadable RMarkdown script for the pipeline. Altogether, paleopal aims to spearhead the next generation of training of computational paleontologists, regardless of age, background, or technical expertise. Further, the modular nature of the app introduces an avenue for other fields to fork and adapt the project for their own needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & ✅ & shiny, workflow, earth sciences, biological sciences, reproducible research                                                          & William Gearty (Syracuse University)                                                           & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

If you are familiar with the R package Flair, Flourish works similarly, but is language agnostic. We will speak in depth about how Flourish dynamically injects styling into a rendered report using Javascript, and the work it took to get to this process.

While a tool may appear promising and seem like the perfect fit for a specific task, early-stage technologies often come with their own set of hurdles. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of comprehensive resources—such as detailed documentation, practical examples, active discussion boards, and community support—which can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues or fully understand the tool’s capabilities. This often requires additional effort, experimentation, and problem-solving to get things working as intended. At last year’s Posit Conference, I was introduced to a new tool called closeread, a Quarto extension designed for vertical scrollytelling. The concept immediately caught my interest because it seemed like an innovative way to enhance storytelling with data. Motivated by its potential, I decided to give it a try shortly after the conference. However, my initial experience was challenging. The tool was only partially functional, and when I encountered technical issues, I struggled to find enough supporting resources to resolve them. The available documentation was limited, examples were scarce, and there wasn’t much discussion happening in community forums. Frustrated by these obstacles, I eventually set the tool aside, unsure of how to move forward. Some time later, I came across a user-contribution contest that reignited my interest in closeread. This contest motivated me to tackle the tool again, but this time with a different mindset. Instead of relying solely on available resources, I approached the problem more systematically—digging into the code, experimenting with different configurations, and learning through trial and error. This hands-on approach, combined with the fresh motivation from the contest, helped me overcome the technical challenges I had faced earlier. Eventually, I was able to get the tool working successfully, and in the process, I gained a deeper understanding of how to navigate the common pitfalls associated with adopting new technology. In my talk, I will share this learning journey in detail, highlighting the strategies that helped me move from frustration to success. I’ll discuss practical approaches for overcoming deployment challenges, including how to troubleshoot effectively when documentation is limited, how to leverage community resources even when they seem sparse, and how to maintain motivation when progress feels slow. I’ll also offer insights into the mindset shifts that can make a big difference—like viewing challenges as opportunities to deepen your technical skills rather than as roadblocks. & ✅ & quarto, closeread, best practices, community, scrollytelling                                                                         & Dror Berel                                                                                     & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

The talk will include a brief overview of the underlying technical details of the parser and abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of these documents in R. Additionally, we will present work to support a number of use cases for these tools to solve practical problems. Examples include building documents that have multiple output variants (e.g. assignments with or without solutions included) and utilities built to support grading and feedback for assignments based on these document formats.

Although various tools exist to simplify the process, they often focus exclusively on R package dependencies and omit the system ones, rely on user-supplied metadata, or create an unnecessarily large environment. We present `r4r`, a tool that automatically traces all dependencies in a pipeline using system call interception. Based on these traces, `r4r` generates a Docker image containing precisely the dependencies needed for reproducible execution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a collection of R Markdown notebooks from Kaggle, illustrating how `r4r` helps ensure fully reproducible workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & ✅ & reproducibility, docker, automation                                                                                                  & Pierre Donat-Bouillud (Czech Technical University); Filip Křikava (Czech Technical University) & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

The wizrd package was born for testing the hypothesis that LLMs can be used to implement functions within larger data science tools and workflows. With wizrd, users can parameterize model inputs, implement logic that delegates to R functions, and constrain outputs to specific R data structures. Finally, configured models can be converted into actual R functions, which can in turn serve as tools for other models, forming a graph of agents. LLM-based programs can be imported from the Langsmith hub, realizing their portability across languages. We will give an overview and demo of the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & ✅ & llm, ai, programming                                                                                                                 & Michael Lawrence                                                                               & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

Any user with R installed can contribute their compute power when idle and harness others when needed. \\# Abstract The Futureverse framework revolutionized parallel computing in R by providing a simple, unified API for parallel evaluation of R code. At its core, the future package allows developers to write code once (e.g. `f <- future(lm(x, y))`), which then may be evaluated on any future-compatible parallel backend. For instance, `plan(multisession)` parallelizes on the local machine, `plan(cluster)` and `plan(mirai\\_cluster)` can parallelize on a set of local or remote machines, and `plan(batchtools\\_slurm)` distributes the computations on a Slurm high-performance compute (HPC) cluster, and so on. Regardless of backend used, getting the value of the future is always the same (e.g. `v <- value(f)`). In this presentation, I introduce a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) future backend that enables distributed parallel computing among friends and colleagues using shared storage. The shared storage can be a local file system or a cloud storage. I will illustrate this concept using the `plan(p2p\\_gdrive)` backend, which leverages Google Drive as a communication medium, where users can offload computational tasks to peers in a shared workspace. When a user creates a future, it ends up in the “todo” folder, where idle peers can detect it, download it, and execute it locally. Once completed, the result is uploaded to the “done” folder, making them available for retrieval by the original user. The Futureverse ecosystem has a simple API, which makes it is easy for anyone to write parallel R code. Because Futureverse is exceedingly well-tested, you can easily and safely scale up code currently running on your local computer to run on distributed P2P clusters. This approach democratizes distributed computing, allowing R users to harness the collective power of their social network without requiring dedicated HPC infrastructure. Come to my talk and learn how you and your friends can get together and share your compute resources, allowing you to run `y <- future\\_lapply(X, my\\_long\\_running\\_analysis)` across their computers, while you share your idle compute resources with them. All this is available from your local R prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                        & ✅ & programming, parallel processing, performance, reproducibility                                                                       & Henrik Bengtsson (University of California San Francisco (UCSF))                               & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

An R user may find their laptop more than sufficient to start their journey with statistical computing, but as datasets grow in size and complexity, so does the necessity for more sophisticated tooling. This talk will step through a set of approaches to scale your tasks beyond in-memory analysis on your local machine, using the Postron IDE: adopting a lazy evaluation engine like DuckDB, connecting to remote databases with fluent workflows, and even migrating from desktop analysis entirely to server or cloud compute using SSH tunnelling. The transition away from a local, in-memory programming paradigm can be challenging for R users, who may not have much exposure to tools or training for these ways of working. This talk will explore available options which make crossing this boundary more approachable, and how they can be used with an advanced development environment suited for statistical computing with R. Integrations in the Positron IDE make all these tasks easier; for example, remote development in Positron allows an R user to seamlessly write code on their local machine, and execute that code on a remote host without tedious interactions outside the IDE. Whether you train statistical models, build interactive apps, or work with large datasets, after this talk you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & ✅ & ide, workflow, tooling, remote development                                                                                           & Julia Silge (Posit PBC)                                                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

It will also show how these tools unlock new opportunities, such as easy access to data in cloud storage, and will explore recent developments in the Arrow and Parquet ecosystems, including for geospatial data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & ✅ & arrow, parquet, duckdb, big data                                                                                                     & Neal Richardson (Posit PBC)                                                                    & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

However, existing data structures such as data.frames or matrices doesn't have a good way of controlling them. You were forced to represent all data as sparse or dense (non-sparse). This means that many modelings workflows uses an non-optimal data structure, that at best slows down computation and at worst won't be computational feasible. This talk will cover how we overcame these issues in tidymodels. Starting with the creation of a sparse vector format that fit in tibbles followed by the wiring needed to make it happen in our packages. The best part is that most users doesn't need to change anything in their code to benefit from these speed improvements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & ✅ & machine learning, tidymodels, sparse data                                                                                            & Emil Hvitfeldt (Posit PBC)                                                                     & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

It has been available for beta testing for a number of months, and R users may have wondered if they should try it or if it will be a good fit for them. This new IDE is an extensible tool built to facilitate exploratory data analysis, reproducible authoring, and publishing data artifacts, and it is an IDE that supports but is not built only for R. How should an R user think about Positron, compared to the other options out there? In this talk, learn about how and why Positron is designed the way it is, what will feel familiar or new coming from other IDEs such as RStudio, and when (or if) people who use R should consider giving it a try. You’ll hear about different choices when it comes to defaults and ways of working, such as how to think about your projects or folders and how to manage multiple versions of R. You will also learn about new functionality for R users and package developers that we have never had before, like new approaches for managing R package tests and the ability to customize an IDE using extensions. If you are curious about Positron and how it fits into the R ecosystem, you’ll come away from this talk with more details about its capabilities and more clarity about whether it may be a good choice for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ✅ | ide, workflow, tooling                                                                                        | Julia Silge (Posit PBC)                                                                                                         | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

With such, we can eliminate the need for manual interventions. In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can use plumber, an R package for building APIs, to create a webhook listener that triggers your workflows such as updating dashboards, triggering machine learning retraining, and other potential use cases. In the presentation, I will cover how to process payloads - using GitHub webhooks as an example, verifying authenticity using HMAC signatures, and implementing logging for tracking script execution, debugging, and monitoring. This talk will benefit researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to make their R workflows responsive to certain triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ✅ | automation, event-driven workflows, plumber api, github webhooks                                              | CLINTON DAVID                                                                                                                   | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Traditional measurement methods often fall short, leaving marketers with more questions than answers: Is TV a dead channel? Is last-click attribution selling your brand-building efforts short? Are you overinvesting in one channel while under-utilising another? In this talk, we will take you beyond surface-level metrics and into the world of econometrics in R: the gold standard for understanding marketing effectiveness. By applying time-series regression techniques, we can move past vanity metrics and gut feelings to uncover the real impact of marketing spend. Attribution is one of the biggest debates in marketing measurement, therefore, this talk will also explore whether first-click, last-click, or equal weightings really make sense - or whether a more nuanced approach is needed to reflect consumer behaviour. Next, we’ll explore how to quantify return on investment with rigor, determine the optimal allocation of budget across channels, visualise the relationship between channels, and understand diminishing returns to avoid wasted spend. All while breaking down key marketing acronyms, campaign types, and measurement approaches to ensure you leave with a clear understanding of how to apply these concepts in the real world. Finally, we will demonstrate our award-winning (IPA, 2024) example case study built in R with December19 Media Agency, for Xero Accounting UK, to bring our time-series regression analyses to life.

CSV format is advantageous for its simplicity. When the data size is small, it is easy to inspect the CSV data using a spreadsheet program. However, CSV files tend to become very slow for read and write operations at larger data sizes. Enter Apache Parquet &gt; Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming language and analytics tools. From Apache Parquet Documentation The talk would focus on an overview of the Apache Parquet format and advantages compared to the CSV format. I would also demonstrate reading and writing data in this format in R and show the interoperability with Apache Arrow. Further, I would demonstrate how this format would make life easier for polyglot teams that use R and Python. Finally, the session would end by mentioning key points to consider to decide their storage format. The participants would get introduced to Apache Parquet and Arrow and be able to better decide storage format for their workflows. Broad Agenda 1. Overview of the Apache Parquet format 2.

While there are good guidelines on how to report the results, data visualization tools are rarely used in understanding the results of EFA. Good data visualization, especially in a multivariate framework with ordinal data, makes it easier for people interpret the results of the analysis better. This presentation introduces and demonstrates different data visualization techniques that can be used to illustrate the results of EFA and improve its interpretation. Advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques are discussed. As EFA is oftentimes used on categorical data from survey research, apart from visualizations for the factor results, exploratory data visualization for categorical variables are also presented. Moreover, these graphical tools can be used for purposes other than EFA. Data visualization and analysis is performed in R using publicly available survey research data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ✅ | factor analysis, exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction, ordinal data, survey research                | Nivedita Bhaktha (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur)                                                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Ensuring that code works correctly with unit-testing is well-established in R, but validating that we write the correct code—aligned with user needs—remains a challenge. In this talk, we’ll explore how Behavior-Driven Development helps collaborating with stakeholders by translating their needs into automated tests that check if our software satisfies them. You’ll walk away with an understanding of how to start practicing BDD in R with {cucumber}: a method of producing tests that describe what your software does, and makes tests easier to maintain as your software evolves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ✅ | testing, behavior-driven development, test-driven development, efficient programming, gherkin                 | Jakub Sobolewski                                                                                                                | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

But how do you go from calling a model to actually building something useful? In this talk, I'll share my experiences creating and deploying LLM-powered applications in R. I'll walk through different approaches I've tried, from incorporating LLMs into Shiny apps, improving my R code, and experimenting with different models and deployment options. Along the way, I'll highlight what worked, what didn't, and what I learned in the process. Whether you're curious about integrating LLMs into your own projects or just want to see what's possible, this session will offer a practical look at building with LLMs in R without the hype.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ✅ | automation, llms, ai                                                                                          | Nic Crane                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

This pipeline was instrumental in allowing the review and use of 2.2 billion rows/175 GB of source data. During the process of developing the sepsis criteria, we received multiple new data deliveries from each site, which required frequent review and re-harmonization of the provided source datasets. This harmonization pipeline consisted of multiple steps including conflating multiple source rows types to one harmonized type, performing source specific unit mapping, and performing value transformations. In an iterative process, clinical experts would identify rows for mapping, data scientists would run the harmonization pipeline, and then clinical experts would review mapped data using Shiny tools custom built for this project. Due to project and dataset size, we leveraged a range of tools including Google BigQuery, R, and make. After harmonization, the cleaned dataset was approximately 1.7 billion rows/155GB in size. This large amount of data required special considerations to perform acceptably. To keep Shiny responsive, to keep the server hosting our Shiny apps from crashing, and to prevent client browser crashes, we had to limit data being reviewed to at most a random sample of 50% of the larger data groupings. ![Application Screenshot][1] [1]: https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/9376248/421070526-1ced6919-a0f8-4dac-9561-afb442c48161.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zYshCSHQCOw9AKIrUIEb15KvmI2lqsls0s-wjxhxE2E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ✅ | big data, shiny, healthcare, data harmonization, rdbms                                                        | Seth Russell (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)                                                                   | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",
       "| 145 | Virtual           | 2025-08-01 | TBD | Online | Intracranial Pressure Monitor Placement Prediction in Children with Traumatic Brain Injury             | Traumatic brain injury causes approximately 2,200 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations in U.S. children annually. Clinicians currently make decisions about placing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor in children with traumatic brain injury without the benefit of an accurate clinical decision support tool. In a prospective observational cohort study, we developed and validated models that predict placement of an ICP monitor. Patient data was gathered from multiple sources and discretized into 5-minute intervals. We divided data into four combinations of nurse documented and chart extracted input data, all including patient level and vital sign variables, and with inclusion or exclusion of data from brain computed tomography imaging reports and invasive blood pressure readings. Using R, we built machine learning models using logistic regression, support vector machines, generalized estimating equations, generalized additive models, and LSTMs. We trained each model with each combination of data. Optimal parameters were identified based on the highest F1. The best performing model, an LSTM deep learning model, achieved an F1 of 0.71 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. The best non-neural network model, standard logistic regression, achieved an F1 of 0.36 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. While non-RNN models did not achieve the best F1, their coefficient size and direction provide insight into factors predicting ICP monitor placement. Additionally, the generalized additive models allow for visualization and interpretation of the marginal impact (after integrating out the impact of the other variables) of a variable over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ✅ | deep learning, machine learning, healthcare, decision making                                                  | Seth Russell (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)                                                                   | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

It allows to submit packages through a user interface or API and to automatically update and publish R and Python repositories. Multiple departments can manage their own repositories and different users can have different roles in the management of their packages. With continuous integration infrastructure for quality assurance on R and Python packages, package uploads can be automated. All configuration is declarative and RDepot can be set up as infrastructure as code, which is especially relevant in regulated contexts, since it makes validation activities much easier. Packages from publicly available R repositories such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages) can be mirrored selectively in custom repositories for use behind a firewall, in internal networks and offline. Combined with [Crane](https://craneserver.net), authentication and fine-grained authorization (using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)) can be configured per repository, which offers extra security when dealing with sensitive data or sensitive methodology. In this talk we will walk R users and developers through different features of RDepot and demonstrate how these can be useful in different scenarios. The logic of the different workflows will be explained and live demos will be given to see the open source solution in action. We will make sure to address needs ranging from small research groups sharing a handful of packages up to multinational companies managing their R (and Python) code across the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ✅ | package management, infrastructure, open source                                                               | Jonas Van Malder                                                                                                                | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

This is a problem for many data science organizations and can now be solved using a novel open source product Crane (https://craneserver.net/). Crane hosts data science artifacts such as data analysis reports, documentation sites, or even packages and libraries. All of these data science artifacts are kept under strict authentication and authorization using modern protocols (OIDC). In this talk, we walk you through the different features of Crane and provide a live demo to explain the concepts. We will discuss its configuration file and demonstrate that authentication in Crane is fully declarative and allows for fine-grained configuration (at user-level, group-level, network-level or using SpEL) while still using an intuitive hierarchical tree that corresponds to the directory structure of the data. Next, we will show how artifacts can be accessed from or uploaded into Crane using the Crane API from R (e.g. to automate report updates, use data science artifacts in CI/CD) or using its customizable UI. Further, we zoom in on audit logs to track operations on all files (e.g. for GxP purposes) and detail the different storage backends (S3 and local file system). To ensure Crane can perform in high security settings the code base has been tested using integration tests reaching a high code coverage of more than 70%. With this talk we want to teach any R user and developer the essentials of Crane and how it can be used to share their data science artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ✅ | data sharing, data, automation, r, repository managment                                                       | Lucianos Lionakis (Open Analytics)                                                                                              | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

In this talk, we will explore how to take Shiny beyond it’s default appearance to create dashboards that are not only visually appealing but also highly usable, accessible, and seamlessly integrated into an organisation’s digital environment. To demonstrate this to our audience, we will share our open-source dashboard in collaboration with the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). While the project required thorough data integration and analysis, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring the dashboard was not just functional but also visually cohesive, highly accessible, and intuitive for a broad range of users—including policymakers with varying levels of data literacy. We’ll start by discussing how to balance the line between over-simplifying and over-complicating data. Like most open-source data, there is a vast library of data, with little documentation on how to interpret it. Therefore, how to optimise open-source government underpins this talk – to ensure interactivity and efficient rendering techniques, so we can keep dashboards responsive and user-friendly. Next, we will be jump into customisation now that the foundations are in place - looking at how custom CSS and JavaScript can be leveraged to break free from the typical Shiny aesthetic, ensuring dashboards align with existing brand guidelines and user expectations. From typography and colour schemes to interactive elements, we’ll discuss techniques to create a polished, professional design that feels like a natural extension of an organisation’s existing web presence. Accessibility is another key factor in dashboard design. Many users—whether government policymakers, corporate stakeholders, or public audiences—have varying levels of data literacy, and a poorly designed interface can create barriers to insight. We’ll cover strategies for making dashboards more intuitive, including thoughtful navigation structures, tooltips, dynamic summaries, and alternative ways to display data for users with different needs. Additionally, we’ll explore best practices for ensuring compliance with accessibility standards, such as improving contrast, enabling keyboard navigation, and implementing screen reader-friendly elements. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to design Shiny dashboards that are not just functional but genuinely enjoyable to use - helping your audience engage with data more effectively and make better-informed decisions with open-source data. | ✅ | shiny apps, dashboard, environmental science, health science, decision-making, customisation                  | Abbie Brookes; Jeremy Horne (Director @ Datacove)                                                                               | Abbie Brookes                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Because of it's flexibility, ShinyProxy is being used by both small startups and large enterprises. Although ShinyProxy was originally tailored towards hosting Shiny apps, it can host virtually any web app. Since ShinyProxy makes it easy to make reproducible apps, even when using multiple R versions, it's often used by pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, it's used by financial and engineering companies as well. ShinyProxy seamlessly integrates with your existing infrastructure (such as authentication providers and databases). The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction to ShinyProxy, explain the use-cases of ShinyProxy and it's unique advantages over other solutions. No deep technical knowledge (e.g. of Docker or Linux) is needed to follow this talk, however, the talk will give you enough information to start using ShinyProxy yourselves. As usual, the development of ShinyProxy has continued, therefore we'll also give a preview of upcoming features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ✅ | shiny,automation,docker,webapp                                                                                | Tobia De Koninck (Open Analytics NV)                                                                                            | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

       "| 130 | Virtual           | 2025-08-01 | TBD | Online | The Future of Asynchronous Programming in R                                                            | Asynchronous programming can be a powerful paradigm, whereby computations are allowed to run concurrently without blocking the main session. It is an opportune time to survey the current landscape, as R infrastructure in this respect has matured significantly over recent years. Instead of running a script sequentially from top to bottom, logic that takes a long or unpredictable amount of time to complete may be offloaded to different R processes, possibly on other computers or in the cloud. In the meantime, the main session may be running constantly and non-interactively, performing operations in real time, synchronizing with these tasks only when necessary. This style of programming requires a very specific set of tooling. At the very base, there is an infrastructure layer involving key enabling packages such as later and mirai. It will be explained at a high level why these two packages together currently offer the most complete and efficient implementation of async for the R language. There are further tools which expand async functionality to cover specific needs, such as the watcher package for filesystem monitoring. There are then a range of tools built on top of these, bringing async capabilities to the end-user, such as the httr2 package for querying APIs and the ellmer package for interacting with LLMs. In addition to these existing tools, exciting developments in asynchronous programming are just around the corner. These will be previewed, together with speculation on what might be possible at some point in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ✅ | asynchronous programming, distributed computing, parallel computing, open source tools                        | Charlie Gao (Posit PBC)                                                                                                         | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",
       "| 162 | Virtual           | 2025-08-01 | TBD | Online | Thinking Inside the {box}: A Structured Approach for Full-Stack App Development                        | As Shiny applications scale, maintaining clean structure, managing dependencies, and ensuring long-term maintainability become increasingly challenging. The {box} package modernizes R’s approach to modularization, while {rhino} provides a structured framework for building robust Shiny apps. Together, they offer a structured and scalable workflow for Shiny development. In this talk we will explore how to leverage {box}'s modularity also for API development, using a structured approach to manage routers, endpoints, filters and error handlers. This workflow takes advantage of the programmatic usage of {plumber}, as an alternative for the annotation-based approach. To understand these concepts in a real-world scenario, this talk will present a case study of a Shiny application that integrates {box} for modular design and {plumber} for structured API development. We will walk through key architectural decisions, demonstrate how modularization improves maintainability, and explore how this approach streamlines both Shiny and API development. This will help attendees gain actionable insights they can apply to their own projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ✅ | modules, shiny, box, api, production                                                                          | Samuel Enrique Calderon Serrano (Appsilon, R Shiny developer)                                                                   | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

As a small, 10-person team formed in 2019 building slow-paced data products with self-imposed goals, such as dashboards, they were hit with difficult tasks to be performed under pressure such as managing information and statistics workflows during a pandemic for a city with 3M inhabitants and serving hundreds of physicians and decision-makers of the public sector with almost real-time information. Over the years, this interdisciplinary team has tripled in size and has played a key role in high-impact strategic data science projects. These include developing data science solutions for extracting information from free-text data, creating complex algorithms for processing data from the city's Electronic Health Records, and implementing large-scale cost recovery initiatives in the healthcare system by cross-referencing massive datasets and generating +35k rendered documents per week shared with key agencies in the city. To fulfill these objectives, the team has built a robust infrastructure and a wide range of digital products—all within the R ecosystem. The talk will cover the strategies, tools, and lessons learned in building efficient and reproducible data workflows in the public sector in a context of very limited resources, and we’ll explore how R has been fundamental in transitioning from individual analyses to scalable, automated workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ✅ | public sector, data science, data mining, workflows, city management                                          | María Cristina Nanton (University of Buenos Aires)                                                                              | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

By just generating markdown and not a finished static site, combining documentation of multiple packages is made easier. `pkgdocs` was made to work well with Hugo and the Docsy theme, but the markdown output should also be usable with other markdown-based static site generators with minor changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ✅ | package, documentation, markdown, stateic site generator                                                      | Daan Seynaeve                                                                                                                   | Anne-Katrin Hess                                                                                                                                                       |\n",
       "| 105 | Virtual           | 2025-08-01 | TBD | Online | rosella: diagnosing and interpreting classification models                                             | Understanding the behavior of complex machine learning models has become a challenge in the modern day. Explainable AI (XAI) methods were introduced to provide insights into model predictions, however interpreting these explanations can be difficult without proper visualisation methods. To fill this gap we have built rosella, an R package offering an interactive Shiny app that visualizes model behavior in the data space alongside XAI explanations. Designed for developers, educators, and students, rosella makes model decisions more accessible and interpretable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ✅ | high dimensional data, explainable ai, interactive tools, machine learning                                    | Janith Wanniarachchi (Monash University)                                                                                        | Dianne Cook (Monash University); Kate Saunders (Monash University); Patricia Menendez (University of Melbourne); Thiyanga Talagala (University of Sri Jayewardenepura) |\n",

Our Shiny-based Collection Dashboard, powered by Gen AI, transforms the way business teams interact with data. The dashboard monitors key metrics like Bounce rate, First EMI Bounce, Current resolution etc., with multi-level filtering by zone, state, region, and branch. To enhance usability, we introduced: - Automated PPT Generation: Users can download a fully customized PowerPoint presentation for any combination of filters. The charts are further enhanced with summaries and actionable items for business by an LLM, providing key takeaways. - \"Talk to Your Data\" (Text2SQL): Business teams can query the data in natural language—e.g., “Which zone had the highest bounce rate this month?”—and receive instant, downloadable reports. By integrating Gen AI, we’ve significantly reduced business teams' dependency on analytics for day-to-day data needs, empowering them with self-serve insights at scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ❌ | gen ai, r shiny , financial data, ppt generation, text2sql                                                    | Arnav Chauhan (Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Ltd.); Sreeram R (Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Ltd) | Arnav Chauhan (Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Ltd.)                                                                                                      |\n",

The georeferenced survey data can contain either latitude and longitude geocoordinates, or an administrative identifier with a corresponding shapefile. The procedure involves: Downloading geospatial indicator data, Shapefile tessellation, Computing Zonal statistics, and spatial joining of geospatial data with unit level data. The package, for example, can be used to link household characteristics measured in surveys with satellite-derived measures such as the average radiance of night-time light. The package can also calculate indicator values for each pixel covered by a tessellated grid in which a household is located. Finally, the package can be used to calculate zonal statistics for a user-defined shapefile (at native resolution or tessellated) and link the results to survey data. GeoLink complements the povmap and EMDI R packages to facilitate small area estimation with geospatial indicators. The latter two packages enable the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation methods and includes tools for processing, assessing, and presenting the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ✅ | social statistics, geospatial indicator, administrative unit, household survey, poverty mapping               | Christopher Lloyd (University of Southampton (WorldPop))                                                                        | Luciano Perfetti-Villa (University of Southampton (School of Geography and Environmental Science))                                                                     |\n",

The broad AI response environment is restricted with specific commands to ensure more controlled outputs. The development of this application utilizes two main packages: shiny and gemini.R. Additionally, several supporting packages, including readxl, ggplot2, olsrr, and reshape2, are used for data import, visualization, and modeling. Finally, the application is deployed using the shinyapps.io platform.

We are going to explore a few of them, showing how they are used normally and how they are not intended to be used, in a style borrowing from [Wat by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat): - Some S3 classes store functions inside the objects and call them from their own methods, akin to having a virtual method table in C++. By changing the stored function, we can make `print(x)` perform arbitrary actions. - Source references are attributes that link executable objects to their source code. An invalid source reference will obscure the real source code of a function, making it look as if it does something different. - Use of lazy evaluation and dynamic bindings can make variable access execute code. - In addition to the normal evaluator that interprets the `LANGSXP` syntax trees, R contains a bytecode evaluator, which is faster. If the bytecode and the normal body of a function disagree in important ways, the results can be very baffling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ✅ | serialization, evaluation                                                                                     | Ivan Krylov (Lomonosov Moscow State University)                                                                                 | NA                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

This presentation explores how the Data Science Consulting Program at North Carolina State University has developed a question-based framework for R programming consultations that transforms how researchers approach data analysis problems. We'll share our structured consultation methodology that helps patrons clarify research objectives, challenge underlying assumptions, and refine analytical approaches before writing a single line of code. Through case studies spanning multiple academic disciplines, we'll demonstrate how strategic questioning fueled by critical thinking has led researchers to revise their analytical strategies, discover more elegant solutions, and sometimes completely reframe their research questions—ultimately producing more robust and meaningful results. This talk will provide practical insights for anyone supporting R users across skill levels, including a typology of questions that promote deeper analytical thinking, strategies for training consultation staff in this approach, and assessment methods to measure success. Whether you're supporting colleagues in industry, mentoring students, teaching workshops, or building a consultation program, you'll learn skills to learn someone’s real versus stated need and communicate technical information back effectively. Join us to explore how the art of asking the right questions can transform technical consultations and position R experts as valuable contributors to the entire research process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ✅ | consulting, research, critical thinking                                                                                              | Abhinandra Singh (North Carolina State University)                                             | Selene Schmittling (North Carolina State University); Alp Tezbasaran (North Carolina State University); Shannon Ricci (North Carolina State University); Mara Blake (North Carolina State University) |\n",

By processing terabytes of global vessel position data transmitted via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and applying machine learning models, we create the most comprehensive view of vessel activities around the world. Our datasets are open to everyone and our aim is to facilitate the access to them to the general scientific community. As part of this goal, we created `gfwr`, an R package that communicates with our public APIs and retrieves our data through three main functions: - `get_vessel_info()` provides access to vessel information from hundreds of thousands of fishing and non-fishing vessels from all over the world, getting identity information based on AIS self-reported data, public registries and authorizations - `get_event()` retrieves event information calculated by our algorithms. This includes encounters at sea, loitering, port visits and fishing events by vessel. - `get_raster()` returns fishing effort based on AIS data. In the package documentation, we created vignettes that show how to concatenate these functions into comprehensive workflows that can be adapted depending on the researcher's needs. By offering access through R, we also contribute to more open, transparent and reproducible science. Since 2022, more than 400 users have used `gfwr`, mostly from institutions in North America and Europe. We are now conducting multilingual training workshops to expand this user base and help promote a culture of transparency in ocean governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ✅ | apis, fisheries science, public data, r package, machine learning                                                                    | Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (Global Fishing Watch)                                                    | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
       "|  28 | Lightning             | 2025-08-10 | 10:30–12:00 | Penn 1      | pretestcad: An R package to calculate PreTest Probability (PTP) scores for obstructive Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)                                | Most clinicians in cardiology use an online portal such as [HeartScore](https://www.escardio.org/Education/Practice-Tools/CVD-prevention-toolbox/HeartScore) to calculate a risk score for a patient. However, as risk scores continue to evolve and update themselves, it can be a tedious process to recalculate the risk score of many patients as these online portal could only do so one patient at a time. As such, there has been a rise of R package dedicated to calculating a patient's risk of having cardiovascular diseases such as [CVrisk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVrisk/index.html), [RiskScorescvd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RiskScorescvd/index.html) and [whoishRisk](https://github.com/DylanRJCollins/whoishRisk) in an automated way. Despite the progress made, pretest risk scores for obstructive CAD is lacking. Hence an R package called [pretestcad](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/pretestcad) was made to fill this gap, allowing users to calculate these scores automatically for many patients. Examples of such scores are the 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) PTP scores, 2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score and the 2020 Winther et. al.

       "|  99 | Lightning             | 2025-08-10 | 10:30–12:00 | Penn 1      | propertee: Flexible Covariance Adjustment and Improved Standard Errors in Analyses of Intact Clusters                                               | In studies with intact clusters, regressing outcomes on an indicator for treatment assignment along with covariates commonly provides an estimate of the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect, with robust sandwich standard errors addressing clustering and possibly heteroskedasticity. Even when treatment assignment is ignorable under the study design, the parametric structure necessary for consistent effect estimation limits the gains in precision one seeks by including covariates. In contrast, differencing estimators take the difference between treated and control individuals in their average difference between outcome and some proxy for confounding effects. The propertee package offers users the opportunity to use a prediction of the outcome under control from a flexible “first-stage” model fit as this proxy. The Neyman variance estimator, the default standard error for difference-in-means estimates, fails to account for sampling variability from the model predictions when applied to this ITT effect estimator. The propertee package addresses this issue by augmenting a novel cluster-robust jackknife estimate of the sampling variability of the difference-in-means with a heteroskedasticity-robust estimate of the variability of the model coefficient estimates. This standard error provides asymptotically valid inference for the ITT effect when the first-stage model dimension grows sufficiently slowly with the size of the fitting sample, while entirely removing downward bias in finite samples, even when the model dimension grows more quickly than the rate necessary for asymptotic unbiasedness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅ | cluster-randomized trials, clustered observational studies, cluster-robust standard errors, causal inference, intent-to-treat effect | Joshua Wasserman (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor)                                          | Ben Hansen (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor)                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

However, existing solutions often suffer from complexity, excessive dependencies, or rigid formatting systems. In response to these challenges, we introduce tinytable, a lightweight yet powerful R package for producing high-quality tables in multiple formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Word, PDF, PNG, Markdown, and Typst. tinytable is designed with a minimalist and intuitive interface while providing extensive customization options. Unlike many existing table-drawing packages, tinytable adheres to a strict design philosophy centered on three principles: separation of data and style, flexibility, and lightweight implementation. First, tinytable ensures that table content remains distinct from formatting instructions, enabling users to generate clean, human-readable code that is easier to edit and debug. Second, the package leverages well-established frameworks such as Bootstrap for HTML and tabularray for LaTeX, providing robust and highly customizable styling capabilities. Third, tinytable prioritizes a lightweight implementation by importing zero third-party R packages by default, reducing computational overhead and improving maintainability. The package was developed to address key limitations observed in existing table-drawing tools, specifically aiming for a simple, flexible, concise, and safe user experience. tinytable provides a streamlined API with a minimal learning curve, allowing users to generate high-quality tables with less code while ensuring strong input validation and informative error messages. Its small and maintainable codebase avoids excessive reliance on regular expressions, making it both efficient and transparent. This presentation will showcase tinytable’s capabilities through applied examples, demonstrating how users can create aesthetically pleasing tables with minimal effort while retaining complete control over their formatting. By offering a zero-dependency, highly customizable, and human-readable approach to table generation, tinytable represents a valuable addition to the R ecosystem for data analysis and reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ✅ | table formatting, latex, html, markdown, reproducible research                                                                       | Vincent Arel-Bundock (Université de Montréal)                                                  | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Using a series of linked regressions, this analysis quantifies how complementary data relate to one another and respond to treatments. Despite these advances, existing software’s rigid assumptions often result in users viewing mediation analysis as a black box. We designed the multimedia R package to make advanced mediation analysis techniques accessible, ensuring that statistical components are interpretable and adaptable. The package provides a uniform interface to direct and indirect effect estimation, synthetic null hypothesis testing, bootstrap confidence interval construction, and sensitivity analysis, enabling experimentation with various mediator and outcome models while maintaining a simple overall workflow. The software includes modules for regularized linear, compositional, random forest, hierarchical, and hurdle modeling, making it well-suited to microbiome data. We illustrate the package through two case studies. The first re-analyzes a study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, uncovering potential mechanistic interactions between the microbiome and disease-associated metabolites, not found in the original study. The second analyzes new data about the influence of mindfulness practice on the microbiome.

It helps avoid invalid conclusions based on false assumptions. For example, the p-value associated with a coefficient in a linear model is unreliable if the mean function being used does not agree sufficiently with the data. Until now, there has been no easy and reliable way in R to test formally whether or not the mean function of a parametric regression model agrees with the data. In my presentation, I shall discuss my new R package, distfreereg, that implements the distribution-free goodness-of-fit testing procedure for parametric regression models introduced by Estate Khmaladze in 2021. I shall outline Khmaladze's algorithm, discuss the main features of the package, and illustrate its use with examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ❌ | goodness-of-fit testing, parametric regression, regression modeling, empirical partial sum process, r package                        | Jesse Miller (University of Minnesota)                                                         | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Our primary tools for reporting and visualization since 2012 have been open source versions of R, R-Studio Server and Shiny Server. In the summer of 2022, we committed to installing Posit® Team in order to simplify package management, collaborative development and report publication. Initially, SPG expected all components of Posit® Team to be operational within six months. The actual time was closer to two and a half years. We struggled with strict corporate IT protocols, missed deadlines, service provider selections and legal issues. In hind sight, six months was an unreasonable expectation, but the actual waiting period could have been shortened dramatically had we prepared properly. The purpose of this presentation is to shed light on some of SPG’s roadblocks to implementation and possibly help other small data science groups implement Posit® Team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅ | posit team, collaboration, workflow                                                                                                  | Lowell Gould (Smithfield Foods)                                                                | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

For our project, this transition was driven by the need for a more cost-effective software tool and to reduce dependency on proprietary software services. However, this transition can present challenges such as training for team members, balancing training with other work commitments, and quality assurance for new programs. We describe the transition to R and RStudio over a 3-month period on a public health project with a team that had varying levels of R programming experience. Included in this discussion is our approach to training and implementation, and results for the project transition as we convert programs focused on data quality checks, data manipulation and processing, and statistical estimation. We touch on lessons learned on how to train new programmers to use R, what worked and did not work in terms of converting existing code, and resource planning needed to further continue this transition across other projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ✅ | training, implementation, public health, open-source, transititon                                                                    | Carlos Petzold (RTI International)                                                             | Adam Lee (RTI International)                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

What started as a proof of concept a few years ago, evolved into Conti’s first-ever Predictive Machine Learning Model for R&amp;D! A wedding, two babies, three lateral moves, and four hires later, our team had also evolved… from mostly R to mostly Python developers. Rewriting 1000+ commits? No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms. The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ✅ | multi-lingual, r, python, docker, mlops                                                                                              | Claudia Penaloza (Continental Tires)                                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The shiny app leverages the swephR High Precision Swiss Ephemeris package for celestial body calculations. Anecdote ======== I witnessed the sky darken for no apparent reason in the fall of 2023. Months later I realized I was witnessing the October 2023 annular solar eclipse. So I began to wonder: How many other eclipse events have I been missing? Broad Topics Covered ==================== Julius Caesar vs Pope Gregory XIII: The Battle for Space-Time ------------------------------------------------------------ While most of the western world adopted the Gregorian calendar (365.2425 days long) by the 20th century for agricultural and cultural reasons, astronomers track time off-earth using the older Julian calendar (365.25 days long). We will briefly touch on why this is, how to convert back-and-forth between Gregorian and Julian to perform astronomical calculations, and other notable phenomena to keep in mind when using R in space. User Input: Flexibility vs Ease-of-Use ====================================== Specifically with regards to earthly longitude/latitude coordinate inputs (required for calculating the alignment of celestial bodies to a Earth-bound viewer), a decision had to be made affecting usability of the shiny app for the end-user based on their ability to easily enter an input location: The Breadth of the swephR Package ================================= The swephR package is useful for calculating not only solar and lunar eclipse events visible from earth but all kids of celestial alignments including: - Planetary positions - The crossing of planets over positions - Fixed star positions - Orbital periods for the Earth, asteroids, etc Biography --------- Tim Bender, Hobbyist Bachelor of Urban Planning from the University of Cincinnati. ~15 years local government experience as an urban planner and transit planner.

Journey with R began with a desire to log transit vehicle real-time location data from an API for analysis but I had no programming experience or knowledge of how to approach the problem. I wouldn’t successfully solve this problem until after about 5 years of self-guided learning.

This talk proposes new ways to extend existing Shiny dashboards to mobile dashboards by using Ionic and JavaScript, while making use of a Rust server for data manipulation and preparation. We'll analyze the integration of Shiny with a mobile frontend Shiny, the benefits offered by Rust in terms of backend efficiency, and the tradeoffs offered between web-based and mobile dashboard interfaces. Finally, we'll assemble everything with a live working proof of concept mobile application that streams a Shiny dashboard into a simplified and responsive user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ✅ | ionic shiny rust react.js                                                                                                            | Anastasiia Kostiv                                                                              | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

This push is a relief for many data-science-minded paleontologists who have previously toiled over writing their own scripts to download, clean, analyze, and visualize their data. Many of these steps are now covered by functions in these new packages (and those of other packages in the R universe). However, this push for more script-based research may introduce a wrench in the existing scientific workflows of less technical researchers who lack a background in coding or cause a greater learning curve for new researchers introduced to the field. Therefore, bridging the gap between visual, hands-on workflows and digital, code-based workflows is imperative to the collaborative future of computational paleontology. Here I present a new Shiny app, paleopal, that provides a user-friendly interface to build paleontological data science workflows. The app connects existing paleontological R packages such as palaeoverse and deeptime with the tidyverse suite of R package to encourage standardized scientific pipelines. Furthermore, the app uses the shinymeta R package to provide a live code and results panel and a downloadable RMarkdown script for the pipeline. Altogether, paleopal aims to spearhead the next generation of training of computational paleontologists, regardless of age, background, or technical expertise. Further, the modular nature of the app introduces an avenue for other fields to fork and adapt the project for their own needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ✅ | shiny, workflow, earth sciences, biological sciences, reproducible research                                                          | William Gearty (Syracuse University)                                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

If you are familiar with the R package Flair, Flourish works similarly, but is language agnostic. We will speak in depth about how Flourish dynamically injects styling into a rendered report using Javascript, and the work it took to get to this process.

While a tool may appear promising and seem like the perfect fit for a specific task, early-stage technologies often come with their own set of hurdles. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of comprehensive resources—such as detailed documentation, practical examples, active discussion boards, and community support—which can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues or fully understand the tool’s capabilities. This often requires additional effort, experimentation, and problem-solving to get things working as intended. At last year’s Posit Conference, I was introduced to a new tool called closeread, a Quarto extension designed for vertical scrollytelling. The concept immediately caught my interest because it seemed like an innovative way to enhance storytelling with data. Motivated by its potential, I decided to give it a try shortly after the conference. However, my initial experience was challenging. The tool was only partially functional, and when I encountered technical issues, I struggled to find enough supporting resources to resolve them. The available documentation was limited, examples were scarce, and there wasn’t much discussion happening in community forums. Frustrated by these obstacles, I eventually set the tool aside, unsure of how to move forward. Some time later, I came across a user-contribution contest that reignited my interest in closeread. This contest motivated me to tackle the tool again, but this time with a different mindset. Instead of relying solely on available resources, I approached the problem more systematically—digging into the code, experimenting with different configurations, and learning through trial and error. This hands-on approach, combined with the fresh motivation from the contest, helped me overcome the technical challenges I had faced earlier. Eventually, I was able to get the tool working successfully, and in the process, I gained a deeper understanding of how to navigate the common pitfalls associated with adopting new technology. In my talk, I will share this learning journey in detail, highlighting the strategies that helped me move from frustration to success. I’ll discuss practical approaches for overcoming deployment challenges, including how to troubleshoot effectively when documentation is limited, how to leverage community resources even when they seem sparse, and how to maintain motivation when progress feels slow. I’ll also offer insights into the mindset shifts that can make a big difference—like viewing challenges as opportunities to deepen your technical skills rather than as roadblocks. | ✅ | quarto, closeread, best practices, community, scrollytelling                                                                         | Dror Berel                                                                                     | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The talk will include a brief overview of the underlying technical details of the parser and abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of these documents in R. Additionally, we will present work to support a number of use cases for these tools to solve practical problems. Examples include building documents that have multiple output variants (e.g. assignments with or without solutions included) and utilities built to support grading and feedback for assignments based on these document formats.

Although various tools exist to simplify the process, they often focus exclusively on R package dependencies and omit the system ones, rely on user-supplied metadata, or create an unnecessarily large environment. We present `r4r`, a tool that automatically traces all dependencies in a pipeline using system call interception. Based on these traces, `r4r` generates a Docker image containing precisely the dependencies needed for reproducible execution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a collection of R Markdown notebooks from Kaggle, illustrating how `r4r` helps ensure fully reproducible workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ✅ | reproducibility, docker, automation                                                                                                  | Pierre Donat-Bouillud (Czech Technical University); Filip Křikava (Czech Technical University) | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The wizrd package was born for testing the hypothesis that LLMs can be used to implement functions within larger data science tools and workflows. With wizrd, users can parameterize model inputs, implement logic that delegates to R functions, and constrain outputs to specific R data structures. Finally, configured models can be converted into actual R functions, which can in turn serve as tools for other models, forming a graph of agents. LLM-based programs can be imported from the Langsmith hub, realizing their portability across languages. We will give an overview and demo of the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅ | llm, ai, programming                                                                                                                 | Michael Lawrence                                                                               | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Any user with R installed can contribute their compute power when idle and harness others when needed. # Abstract The Futureverse framework revolutionized parallel computing in R by providing a simple, unified API for parallel evaluation of R code. At its core, the future package allows developers to write code once (e.g. `f &lt;- future(lm(x, y))`), which then may be evaluated on any future-compatible parallel backend. For instance, `plan(multisession)` parallelizes on the local machine, `plan(cluster)` and `plan(mirai_cluster)` can parallelize on a set of local or remote machines, and `plan(batchtools_slurm)` distributes the computations on a Slurm high-performance compute (HPC) cluster, and so on. Regardless of backend used, getting the value of the future is always the same (e.g. `v &lt;- value(f)`). In this presentation, I introduce a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) future backend that enables distributed parallel computing among friends and colleagues using shared storage. The shared storage can be a local file system or a cloud storage. I will illustrate this concept using the `plan(p2p_gdrive)` backend, which leverages Google Drive as a communication medium, where users can offload computational tasks to peers in a shared workspace. When a user creates a future, it ends up in the “todo” folder, where idle peers can detect it, download it, and execute it locally. Once completed, the result is uploaded to the “done” folder, making them available for retrieval by the original user. The Futureverse ecosystem has a simple API, which makes it is easy for anyone to write parallel R code. Because Futureverse is exceedingly well-tested, you can easily and safely scale up code currently running on your local computer to run on distributed P2P clusters. This approach democratizes distributed computing, allowing R users to harness the collective power of their social network without requiring dedicated HPC infrastructure. Come to my talk and learn how you and your friends can get together and share your compute resources, allowing you to run `y &lt;- future_lapply(X, my_long_running_analysis)` across their computers, while you share your idle compute resources with them. All this is available from your local R prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                        | ✅ | programming, parallel processing, performance, reproducibility                                                                       | Henrik Bengtsson (University of California San Francisco (UCSF))                               | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

An R user may find their laptop more than sufficient to start their journey with statistical computing, but as datasets grow in size and complexity, so does the necessity for more sophisticated tooling. This talk will step through a set of approaches to scale your tasks beyond in-memory analysis on your local machine, using the Postron IDE: adopting a lazy evaluation engine like DuckDB, connecting to remote databases with fluent workflows, and even migrating from desktop analysis entirely to server or cloud compute using SSH tunnelling. The transition away from a local, in-memory programming paradigm can be challenging for R users, who may not have much exposure to tools or training for these ways of working. This talk will explore available options which make crossing this boundary more approachable, and how they can be used with an advanced development environment suited for statistical computing with R. Integrations in the Positron IDE make all these tasks easier; for example, remote development in Positron allows an R user to seamlessly write code on their local machine, and execute that code on a remote host without tedious interactions outside the IDE. Whether you train statistical models, build interactive apps, or work with large datasets, after this talk you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ✅ | ide, workflow, tooling, remote development                                                                                           | Julia Silge (Posit PBC)                                                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

It will also show how these tools unlock new opportunities, such as easy access to data in cloud storage, and will explore recent developments in the Arrow and Parquet ecosystems, including for geospatial data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ✅ | arrow, parquet, duckdb, big data                                                                                                     | Neal Richardson (Posit PBC)                                                                    | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

However, existing data structures such as data.frames or matrices doesn't have a good way of controlling them. You were forced to represent all data as sparse or dense (non-sparse). This means that many modelings workflows uses an non-optimal data structure, that at best slows down computation and at worst won't be computational feasible. This talk will cover how we overcame these issues in tidymodels. Starting with the creation of a sparse vector format that fit in tibbles followed by the wiring needed to make it happen in our packages. The best part is that most users doesn't need to change anything in their code to benefit from these speed improvements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅ | machine learning, tidymodels, sparse data                                                                                            | Emil Hvitfeldt (Posit PBC)                                                                     | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

       "2   Positron is a next generation data science IDE built by the creators of RStudio. It has been available for beta testing for a number of months, and R users may have wondered if they should try it or if it will be a good fit for them. This new IDE is an extensible tool built to facilitate exploratory data analysis, reproducible authoring, and publishing data artifacts, and it is an IDE that supports but is not built only for R. How should an R user think about Positron, compared to the other options out there? In this talk, learn about how and why Positron is designed the way it is, what will feel familiar or new coming from other IDEs such as RStudio, and when (or if) people who use R should consider giving it a try. You’ll hear about different choices when it comes to defaults and ways of working, such as how to think about your projects or folders and how to manage multiple versions of R. You will also learn about new functionality for R users and package developers that we have never had before, like new approaches for managing R package tests and the ability to customize an IDE using extensions. If you are curious about Positron and how it fits into the R ecosystem, you’ll come away from this talk with more details about its capabilities and more clarity about whether it may be a good choice for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3   This talk provides an introduction to working with IPUMS Census American Community Survey (ACS) data in R, focusing on key techniques for data preparation, weighting, and sampling. Participants will gain a foundational understanding of how Census data is structured and learn how to apply statistical weights to create representative analyses. The talk also explores the role of Census data in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), highlighting its applications in model training, fairness assessments, and demographic insights. Finally, the course addresses the critical use of Census data in anti-discrimination frameworks, demonstrating how demographic techniques can help evaluate bias and promote equitable AI/ML outcomes. Through practical exercises and case studies, participants will develop essential skills for integrating Census data into AI-driven analyses with an emphasis on equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4   Webhooks have brought to us new possibilities for automating workflows. With such, we can eliminate the need for manual interventions. In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can use plumber, an R package for building APIs, to create a webhook listener that triggers your workflows such as updating dashboards, triggering machine learning retraining, and other potential use cases. In the presentation, I will cover how to process payloads - using GitHub webhooks as an example, verifying authenticity using HMAC signatures, and implementing logging for tracking script execution, debugging, and monitoring. This talk will benefit researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to make their R workflows responsive to certain triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "5   In a world where marketing budgets are scrutinised, customer journeys are more fragmented than ever, and every digital channel feels as though it’s taking over the world - how do you really know where to invest? Traditional measurement methods often fall short, leaving marketers with more questions than answers: Is TV a dead channel? Is last-click attribution selling your brand-building efforts short? Are you overinvesting in one channel while under-utilising another? In this talk, we will take you beyond surface-level metrics and into the world of econometrics in R: the gold standard for understanding marketing effectiveness. By applying time-series regression techniques, we can move past vanity metrics and gut feelings to uncover the real impact of marketing spend. Attribution is one of the biggest debates in marketing measurement, therefore, this talk will also explore whether first-click, last-click, or equal weightings really make sense - or whether a more nuanced approach is needed to reflect consumer behaviour. Next, we’ll explore how to quantify return on investment with rigor, determine the optimal allocation of budget across channels, visualise the relationship between channels, and understand diminishing returns to avoid wasted spend. All while breaking down key marketing acronyms, campaign types, and measurement approaches to ensure you leave with a clear understanding of how to apply these concepts in the real world. Finally, we will demonstrate our award-winning (IPA, 2024) example case study built in R with December19 Media Agency, for Xero Accounting UK, to bring our time-series regression analyses to life. If you’re looking for a session that moves beyond generic reporting and 6-figure marketing agency prices – this talk is made for you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "6   CSV is arguably the default data storage format for analytics teams. CSV format is advantageous for its simplicity. When the data size is small, it is easy to inspect the CSV data using a spreadsheet program. However, CSV files tend to become very slow for read and write operations at larger data sizes. Enter Apache Parquet > Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming language and analytics tools. From Apache Parquet Documentation The talk would focus on an overview of the Apache Parquet format and advantages compared to the CSV format. I would also demonstrate reading and writing data in this format in R and show the interoperability with Apache Arrow. Further, I would demonstrate how this format would make life easier for polyglot teams that use R and Python. Finally, the session would end by mentioning key points to consider to decide their storage format. The participants would get introduced to Apache Parquet and Arrow and be able to better decide storage format for their workflows. Broad Agenda 1. Overview of the Apache Parquet format 2.

       "7   Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is routinely used by researchers to reduce dimensionality of data, and to form meaningful factors. While there are good guidelines on how to report the results, data visualization tools are rarely used in understanding the results of EFA. Good data visualization, especially in a multivariate framework with ordinal data, makes it easier for people interpret the results of the analysis better. This presentation introduces and demonstrates different data visualization techniques that can be used to illustrate the results of EFA and improve its interpretation. Advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques are discussed. As EFA is oftentimes used on categorical data from survey research, apart from visualizations for the factor results, exploratory data visualization for categorical variables are also presented. Moreover, these graphical tools can be used for purposes other than EFA. Data visualization and analysis is performed in R using publicly available survey research data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8   The fact that your code works doesn't mean it's useful to your users. Ensuring that code works correctly with unit-testing is well-established in R, but validating that we write the correct code—aligned with user needs—remains a challenge. In this talk, we’ll explore how Behavior-Driven Development helps collaborating with stakeholders by translating their needs into automated tests that check if our software satisfies them. You’ll walk away with an understanding of how to start practicing BDD in R with {cucumber}: a method of producing tests that describe what your software does, and makes tests easier to maintain as your software evolves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "9   Large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly easy to use and at their core, they're just an API call away. But how do you go from calling a model to actually building something useful? In this talk, I'll share my experiences creating and deploying LLM-powered applications in R. I'll walk through different approaches I've tried, from incorporating LLMs into Shiny apps, improving my R code, and experimenting with different models and deployment options. Along the way, I'll highlight what worked, what didn't, and what I learned in the process. Whether you're curious about integrating LLMs into your own projects or just want to see what's possible, this session will offer a practical look at building with LLMs in R without the hype.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "11  In support of a large international, multi-site health care project that developed a new pediatric sepsis criteria, we created a pipeline to allow clinical experts to harmonize medications, observations, events, and laboratory measurements from electronic medical record extracts. This pipeline was instrumental in allowing the review and use of 2.2 billion rows/175 GB of source data. During the process of developing the sepsis criteria, we received multiple new data deliveries from each site, which required frequent review and re-harmonization of the provided source datasets. This harmonization pipeline consisted of multiple steps including conflating multiple source rows types to one harmonized type, performing source specific unit mapping, and performing value transformations. In an iterative process, clinical experts would identify rows for mapping, data scientists would run the harmonization pipeline, and then clinical experts would review mapped data using Shiny tools custom built for this project. Due to project and dataset size, we leveraged a range of tools including Google BigQuery, R, and make. After harmonization, the cleaned dataset was approximately 1.7 billion rows/155GB in size. This large amount of data required special considerations to perform acceptably. To keep Shiny responsive, to keep the server hosting our Shiny apps from crashing, and to prevent client browser crashes, we had to limit data being reviewed to at most a random sample of 50% of the larger data groupings. ![Application Screenshot][1] [1]: https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/9376248/421070526-1ced6919-a0f8-4dac-9561-afb442c48161.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zYshCSHQCOw9AKIrUIEb15KvmI2lqsls0s-wjxhxE2E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "12  Traumatic brain injury causes approximately 2,200 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations in U.S. children annually. Clinicians currently make decisions about placing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor in children with traumatic brain injury without the benefit of an accurate clinical decision support tool. In a prospective observational cohort study, we developed and validated models that predict placement of an ICP monitor. Patient data was gathered from multiple sources and discretized into 5-minute intervals. We divided data into four combinations of nurse documented and chart extracted input data, all including patient level and vital sign variables, and with inclusion or exclusion of data from brain computed tomography imaging reports and invasive blood pressure readings. Using R, we built machine learning models using logistic regression, support vector machines, generalized estimating equations, generalized additive models, and LSTMs. We trained each model with each combination of data. Optimal parameters were identified based on the highest F1. The best performing model, an LSTM deep learning model, achieved an F1 of 0.71 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. The best non-neural network model, standard logistic regression, achieved an F1 of 0.36 within 720 minutes of hospital arrival. While non-RNN models did not achieve the best F1, their coefficient size and direction provide insight into factors predicting ICP monitor placement. Additionally, the generalized additive models allow for visualization and interpretation of the marginal impact (after integrating out the impact of the other variables) of a variable over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "14  [RDepot](https://rdepot.io) is a solution for the management of R and Python package repositories in an enterprise environment. It allows to submit packages through a user interface or API and to automatically update and publish R and Python repositories. Multiple departments can manage their own repositories and different users can have different roles in the management of their packages. With continuous integration infrastructure for quality assurance on R and Python packages, package uploads can be automated. All configuration is declarative and RDepot can be set up as infrastructure as code, which is especially relevant in regulated contexts, since it makes validation activities much easier. Packages from publicly available R repositories such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages) can be mirrored selectively in custom repositories for use behind a firewall, in internal networks and offline. Combined with [Crane](https://craneserver.net), authentication and fine-grained authorization (using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)) can be configured per repository, which offers extra security when dealing with sensitive data or sensitive methodology. In this talk we will walk R users and developers through different features of RDepot and demonstrate how these can be useful in different scenarios. The logic of the different workflows will be explained and live demos will be given to see the open source solution in action. We will make sure to address needs ranging from small research groups sharing a handful of packages up to multinational companies managing their R (and Python) code across the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "15  Do you have to share many data science artifacts across teams? This is a problem for many data science organizations and can now be solved using a novel open source product Crane (https://craneserver.net/). Crane hosts data science artifacts such as data analysis reports, documentation sites, or even packages and libraries. All of these data science artifacts are kept under strict authentication and authorization using modern protocols (OIDC). In this talk, we walk you through the different features of Crane and provide a live demo to explain the concepts. We will discuss its configuration file and demonstrate that authentication in Crane is fully declarative and allows for fine-grained configuration (at user-level, group-level, network-level or using SpEL) while still using an intuitive hierarchical tree that corresponds to the directory structure of the data. Next, we will show how artifacts can be accessed from or uploaded into Crane using the Crane API from R (e.g. to automate report updates, use data science artifacts in CI/CD) or using its customizable UI. Further, we zoom in on audit logs to track operations on all files (e.g. for GxP purposes) and detail the different storage backends (S3 and local file system). To ensure Crane can perform in high security settings the code base has been tested using integration tests reaching a high code coverage of more than 70%. With this talk we want to teach any R user and developer the essentials of Crane and how it can be used to share their data science artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "16  Shiny dashboards are a powerful tool for visualising and interacting with data, but without thoughtful design, they can feel generic, clunky, or even inaccessible to key users. In this talk, we will explore how to take Shiny beyond it’s default appearance to create dashboards that are not only visually appealing but also highly usable, accessible, and seamlessly integrated into an organisation’s digital environment. To demonstrate this to our audience, we will share our open-source dashboard in collaboration with the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). While the project required thorough data integration and analysis, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring the dashboard was not just functional but also visually cohesive, highly accessible, and intuitive for a broad range of users—including policymakers with varying levels of data literacy. We’ll start by discussing how to balance the line between over-simplifying and over-complicating data. Like most open-source data, there is a vast library of data, with little documentation on how to interpret it. Therefore, how to optimise open-source government underpins this talk – to ensure interactivity and efficient rendering techniques, so we can keep dashboards responsive and user-friendly. Next, we will be jump into customisation now that the foundations are in place - looking at how custom CSS and JavaScript can be leveraged to break free from the typical Shiny aesthetic, ensuring dashboards align with existing brand guidelines and user expectations. From typography and colour schemes to interactive elements, we’ll discuss techniques to create a polished, professional design that feels like a natural extension of an organisation’s existing web presence. Accessibility is another key factor in dashboard design. Many users—whether government policymakers, corporate stakeholders, or public audiences—have varying levels of data literacy, and a poorly designed interface can create barriers to insight. We’ll cover strategies for making dashboards more intuitive, including thoughtful navigation structures, tooltips, dynamic summaries, and alternative ways to display data for users with different needs. Additionally, we’ll explore best practices for ensuring compliance with accessibility standards, such as improving contrast, enabling keyboard navigation, and implementing screen reader-friendly elements. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to design Shiny dashboards that are not just functional but genuinely enjoyable to use - helping your audience engage with data more effectively and make better-informed decisions with open-source data.\n",
       "17  ShinyProxy (https://shinyproxy.io/) is a 100% open source framework to deploy Shiny (and other) apps or web-based IDEs (like RStudio). Because of it's flexibility, ShinyProxy is being used by both small startups and large enterprises. Although ShinyProxy was originally tailored towards hosting Shiny apps, it can host virtually any web app. Since ShinyProxy makes it easy to make reproducible apps, even when using multiple R versions, it's often used by pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, it's used by financial and engineering companies as well. ShinyProxy seamlessly integrates with your existing infrastructure (such as authentication providers and databases). The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction to ShinyProxy, explain the use-cases of ShinyProxy and it's unique advantages over other solutions. No deep technical knowledge (e.g. of Docker or Linux) is needed to follow this talk, however, the talk will give you enough information to start using ShinyProxy yourselves. As usual, the development of ShinyProxy has continued, therefore we'll also give a preview of upcoming features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "18  The presentation discusses the aspects of application development and deployment that are spanning beyond the Shiny application itself: data storage and access, user management and authentication, observability and telemetry, multi-lingual microservices for complex task delegation, caching, and more. All these infrastructural elements can be created and used with the Free and open-source software such as the Docker engine, PostgreSQL, OpenLDAP, Shinyproxy, R language and various R packages, etc. The entire system of all services communicating with each other is facilitated by Docker-Compose and can be mapped on a single diagram. The diagram is presented during the talk to provide a clear understanding and a high-level overview of system design concepts. Author will also present practical examples, guidelines and tips on how to design and ship a complete solution from scratch. After the talk the audience may expect virtual handout materials provided through the means of a Github repository, which can be used as a starting template for their own projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "19  Asynchronous programming can be a powerful paradigm, whereby computations are allowed to run concurrently without blocking the main session. It is an opportune time to survey the current landscape, as R infrastructure in this respect has matured significantly over recent years. Instead of running a script sequentially from top to bottom, logic that takes a long or unpredictable amount of time to complete may be offloaded to different R processes, possibly on other computers or in the cloud. In the meantime, the main session may be running constantly and non-interactively, performing operations in real time, synchronizing with these tasks only when necessary. This style of programming requires a very specific set of tooling. At the very base, there is an infrastructure layer involving key enabling packages such as later and mirai. It will be explained at a high level why these two packages together currently offer the most complete and efficient implementation of async for the R language. There are further tools which expand async functionality to cover specific needs, such as the watcher package for filesystem monitoring. There are then a range of tools built on top of these, bringing async capabilities to the end-user, such as the httr2 package for querying APIs and the ellmer package for interacting with LLMs. In addition to these existing tools, exciting developments in asynchronous programming are just around the corner. These will be previewed, together with speculation on what might be possible at some point in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "20  As Shiny applications scale, maintaining clean structure, managing dependencies, and ensuring long-term maintainability become increasingly challenging. The {box} package modernizes R’s approach to modularization, while {rhino} provides a structured framework for building robust Shiny apps. Together, they offer a structured and scalable workflow for Shiny development. In this talk we will explore how to leverage {box}'s modularity also for API development, using a structured approach to manage routers, endpoints, filters and error handlers. This workflow takes advantage of the programmatic usage of {plumber}, as an alternative for the annotation-based approach. To understand these concepts in a real-world scenario, this talk will present a case study of a Shiny application that integrates {box} for modular design and {plumber} for structured API development. We will walk through key architectural decisions, demonstrate how modularization improves maintainability, and explore how this approach streamlines both Shiny and API development. This will help attendees gain actionable insights they can apply to their own projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "21  The Health Information and Statistics Office within the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina, faced some key and unexpected challenges in its first year as an organization. As a small, 10-person team formed in 2019 building slow-paced data products with self-imposed goals, such as dashboards, they were hit with difficult tasks to be performed under pressure such as managing information and statistics workflows during a pandemic for a city with 3M inhabitants and serving hundreds of physicians and decision-makers of the public sector with almost real-time information. Over the years, this interdisciplinary team has tripled in size and has played a key role in high-impact strategic data science projects. These include developing data science solutions for extracting information from free-text data, creating complex algorithms for processing data from the city's Electronic Health Records, and implementing large-scale cost recovery initiatives in the healthcare system by cross-referencing massive datasets and generating +35k rendered documents per week shared with key agencies in the city. To fulfill these objectives, the team has built a robust infrastructure and a wide range of digital products—all within the R ecosystem. The talk will cover the strategies, tools, and lessons learned in building efficient and reproducible data workflows in the public sector in a context of very limited resources, and we’ll explore how R has been fundamental in transitioning from individual analyses to scalable, automated workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "22  `pkgdocs` is a new R package to generate package documentation as markdown from an R source package. Compared to other tools, `pkgdocs` is not focused on generating a static website directly, but rather pages that can be included in a larger documentation site. A common pattern in big projects is to modularize development in several R packages. By just generating markdown and not a finished static site, combining documentation of multiple packages is made easier. `pkgdocs` was made to work well with Hugo and the Docsy theme, but the markdown output should also be usable with other markdown-based static site generators with minor changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "23  Understanding the behavior of complex machine learning models has become a challenge in the modern day. Explainable AI (XAI) methods were introduced to provide insights into model predictions, however interpreting these explanations can be difficult without proper visualisation methods. To fill this gap we have built rosella, an R package offering an interactive Shiny app that visualizes model behavior in the data space alongside XAI explanations. Designed for developers, educators, and students, rosella makes model decisions more accessible and interpretable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "27  GeoLink is an R package that assists users with merging publicly available geospatial indicators with georeferenced survey data. The georeferenced survey data can contain either latitude and longitude geocoordinates, or an administrative identifier with a corresponding shapefile. The procedure involves: Downloading geospatial indicator data, Shapefile tessellation, Computing Zonal statistics, and spatial joining of geospatial data with unit level data. The package, for example, can be used to link household characteristics measured in surveys with satellite-derived measures such as the average radiance of night-time light. The package can also calculate indicator values for each pixel covered by a tessellated grid in which a household is located. Finally, the package can be used to calculate zonal statistics for a user-defined shapefile (at native resolution or tessellated) and link the results to survey data. GeoLink complements the povmap and EMDI R packages to facilitate small area estimation with geospatial indicators. The latter two packages enable the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation methods and includes tools for processing, assessing, and presenting the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

It also includes scenario testing features to simulate various staffing and resource allocation strategies. Results: The machine learning models successfully predict demand patterns, allowing clinics to anticipate busy periods and allocate resources effectively. The ggplot2-based visualization platform offers dynamic and customizable charts, making it easy for dermatologists to understand their clinic's data. The scenario testing feature enables clinics to visualize the impact of different staffing and resource allocation strategies, facilitating data-driven decision-making. Conclusion: Combining machine learning forecasts with interactive visualizations empowers dermatological clinics to enhance efficiency, improve patient care, and manage resources effectively. This holistic approach ensures that clinics are well-prepared to meet patient demand, optimize operations, and deliver superior care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "30  Some of the features of R can be misused to do very confusing if not outright misleading things. We are going to explore a few of them, showing how they are used normally and how they are not intended to be used, in a style borrowing from [Wat by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat): - Some S3 classes store functions inside the objects and call them from their own methods, akin to having a virtual method table in C++. By changing the stored function, we can make `print(x)` perform arbitrary actions. - Source references are attributes that link executable objects to their source code. An invalid source reference will obscure the real source code of a function, making it look as if it does something different. - Use of lazy evaluation and dynamic bindings can make variable access execute code. - In addition to the normal evaluator that interprets the `LANGSXP` syntax trees, R contains a bytecode evaluator, which is faster. If the bytecode and the normal body of a function disagree in important ways, the results can be very baffling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "99  Custom functions using {ggplot2} can decrease repetition in the exploratory phase of an analysis, but they can also be incredibly useful for highlighting and telling stories when communicating final results. This session features a visualization sequence demonstrating how functions can break {ggplot2} figures into pieces for ease of interpretation in a presentation setting. Audience members will come away from the session with a broadened view of how transparency levels and color can be used as function arguments to reveal sections of visuals piece by piece.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "100 In data science consultations, the path to success often begins not with providing immediate technical solutions, but with asking the right questions. This presentation explores how the Data Science Consulting Program at North Carolina State University has developed a question-based framework for R programming consultations that transforms how researchers approach data analysis problems. We'll share our structured consultation methodology that helps patrons clarify research objectives, challenge underlying assumptions, and refine analytical approaches before writing a single line of code. Through case studies spanning multiple academic disciplines, we'll demonstrate how strategic questioning fueled by critical thinking has led researchers to revise their analytical strategies, discover more elegant solutions, and sometimes completely reframe their research questions—ultimately producing more robust and meaningful results. This talk will provide practical insights for anyone supporting R users across skill levels, including a typology of questions that promote deeper analytical thinking, strategies for training consultation staff in this approach, and assessment methods to measure success. Whether you're supporting colleagues in industry, mentoring students, teaching workshops, or building a consultation program, you'll learn skills to learn someone’s real versus stated need and communicate technical information back effectively. Join us to explore how the art of asking the right questions can transform technical consultations and position R experts as valuable contributors to the entire research process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "101 At Global Fishing Watch, we create and publicly share knowledge about human activity at sea to enable fair and sustainable use of our ocean. By processing terabytes of global vessel position data transmitted via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and applying machine learning models, we create the most comprehensive view of vessel activities around the world. Our datasets are open to everyone and our aim is to facilitate the access to them to the general scientific community. As part of this goal, we created `gfwr`, an R package that communicates with our public APIs and retrieves our data through three main functions: - `get_vessel_info()` provides access to vessel information from hundreds of thousands of fishing and non-fishing vessels from all over the world, getting identity information based on AIS self-reported data, public registries and authorizations - `get_event()` retrieves event information calculated by our algorithms. This includes encounters at sea, loitering, port visits and fishing events by vessel. - `get_raster()` returns fishing effort based on AIS data. In the package documentation, we created vignettes that show how to concatenate these functions into comprehensive workflows that can be adapted depending on the researcher's needs. By offering access through R, we also contribute to more open, transparent and reproducible science. Since 2022, more than 400 users have used `gfwr`, mostly from institutions in North America and Europe. We are now conducting multilingual training workshops to expand this user base and help promote a culture of transparency in ocean governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "102 Most clinicians in cardiology use an online portal such as [HeartScore](https://www.escardio.org/Education/Practice-Tools/CVD-prevention-toolbox/HeartScore) to calculate a risk score for a patient. However, as risk scores continue to evolve and update themselves, it can be a tedious process to recalculate the risk score of many patients as these online portal could only do so one patient at a time. As such, there has been a rise of R package dedicated to calculating a patient's risk of having cardiovascular diseases such as [CVrisk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVrisk/index.html), [RiskScorescvd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RiskScorescvd/index.html) and [whoishRisk](https://github.com/DylanRJCollins/whoishRisk) in an automated way. Despite the progress made, pretest risk scores for obstructive CAD is lacking. Hence an R package called [pretestcad](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/pretestcad) was made to fill this gap, allowing users to calculate these scores automatically for many patients. Examples of such scores are the 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) PTP scores, 2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score and the 2020 Winther et. al. Risk-Factor-weighted Clinical Likelihood (RF-CL) and Coronary Artery Calcium Score-Weighted Clinical Likelihood (CACS-CL) PTP which was recommended to be used in the [2024 ESC Guidelines](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/45/36/3415/7743115). I hope that presenting this R package in this conference could not only raise awareness of the package in the medical field but also collaboration to make the R package more accessible and user friendly and to expand my knowledge of other pretest scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "103 In studies with intact clusters, regressing outcomes on an indicator for treatment assignment along with covariates commonly provides an estimate of the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect, with robust sandwich standard errors addressing clustering and possibly heteroskedasticity. Even when treatment assignment is ignorable under the study design, the parametric structure necessary for consistent effect estimation limits the gains in precision one seeks by including covariates. In contrast, differencing estimators take the difference between treated and control individuals in their average difference between outcome and some proxy for confounding effects. The propertee package offers users the opportunity to use a prediction of the outcome under control from a flexible “first-stage” model fit as this proxy. The Neyman variance estimator, the default standard error for difference-in-means estimates, fails to account for sampling variability from the model predictions when applied to this ITT effect estimator. The propertee package addresses this issue by augmenting a novel cluster-robust jackknife estimate of the sampling variability of the difference-in-means with a heteroskedasticity-robust estimate of the variability of the model coefficient estimates. This standard error provides asymptotically valid inference for the ITT effect when the first-stage model dimension grows sufficiently slowly with the size of the fitting sample, while entirely removing downward bias in finite samples, even when the model dimension grows more quickly than the rate necessary for asymptotic unbiasedness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "104 The R ecosystem offers a wide range of packages for generating tables in various formats. However, existing solutions often suffer from complexity, excessive dependencies, or rigid formatting systems. In response to these challenges, we introduce tinytable, a lightweight yet powerful R package for producing high-quality tables in multiple formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Word, PDF, PNG, Markdown, and Typst. tinytable is designed with a minimalist and intuitive interface while providing extensive customization options. Unlike many existing table-drawing packages, tinytable adheres to a strict design philosophy centered on three principles: separation of data and style, flexibility, and lightweight implementation. First, tinytable ensures that table content remains distinct from formatting instructions, enabling users to generate clean, human-readable code that is easier to edit and debug. Second, the package leverages well-established frameworks such as Bootstrap for HTML and tabularray for LaTeX, providing robust and highly customizable styling capabilities. Third, tinytable prioritizes a lightweight implementation by importing zero third-party R packages by default, reducing computational overhead and improving maintainability.

       "107 Mediation analysis has emerged as a versatile tool for answering mechanistic questions in microbiome research because it provides a statistical framework for attributing treatment effects to alternative causal pathways. Using a series of linked regressions, this analysis quantifies how complementary data relate to one another and respond to treatments. Despite these advances, existing software’s rigid assumptions often result in users viewing mediation analysis as a black box. We designed the multimedia R package to make advanced mediation analysis techniques accessible, ensuring that statistical components are interpretable and adaptable. The package provides a uniform interface to direct and indirect effect estimation, synthetic null hypothesis testing, bootstrap confidence interval construction, and sensitivity analysis, enabling experimentation with various mediator and outcome models while maintaining a simple overall workflow. The software includes modules for regularized linear, compositional, random forest, hierarchical, and hurdle modeling, making it well-suited to microbiome data. We illustrate the package through two case studies. The first re-analyzes a study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, uncovering potential mechanistic interactions between the microbiome and disease-associated metabolites, not found in the original study. The second analyzes new data about the influence of mindfulness practice on the microbiome.

       "108 Goodness-of-fit testing is a crucial step in verifying the reliability of inferences drawn from a parametric regression model. It helps avoid invalid conclusions based on false assumptions. For example, the p-value associated with a coefficient in a linear model is unreliable if the mean function being used does not agree sufficiently with the data. Until now, there has been no easy and reliable way in R to test formally whether or not the mean function of a parametric regression model agrees with the data. In my presentation, I shall discuss my new R package, distfreereg, that implements the distribution-free goodness-of-fit testing procedure for parametric regression models introduced by Estate Khmaladze in 2021. I shall outline Khmaladze's algorithm, discuss the main features of the package, and illustrate its use with examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "109 We are Smithfield Premium Genetics (SPG), a small department in Smithfield Foods that analyzes and reports on a wide variety of data. Our primary tools for reporting and visualization since 2012 have been open source versions of R, R-Studio Server and Shiny Server. In the summer of 2022, we committed to installing Posit® Team in order to simplify package management, collaborative development and report publication. Initially, SPG expected all components of Posit® Team to be operational within six months. The actual time was closer to two and a half years. We struggled with strict corporate IT protocols, missed deadlines, service provider selections and legal issues. In hind sight, six months was an unreasonable expectation, but the actual waiting period could have been shortened dramatically had we prepared properly. The purpose of this presentation is to shed light on some of SPG’s roadblocks to implementation and possibly help other small data science groups implement Posit® Team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "110 Many organizations are looking to switch to open-source software for its cost-effectiveness, greater flexibility, and better long-term maintainability compared to other software. For our project, this transition was driven by the need for a more cost-effective software tool and to reduce dependency on proprietary software services. However, this transition can present challenges such as training for team members, balancing training with other work commitments, and quality assurance for new programs. We describe the transition to R and RStudio over a 3-month period on a public health project with a team that had varying levels of R programming experience. Included in this discussion is our approach to training and implementation, and results for the project transition as we convert programs focused on data quality checks, data manipulation and processing, and statistical estimation. We touch on lessons learned on how to train new programmers to use R, what worked and did not work in terms of converting existing code, and resource planning needed to further continue this transition across other projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "111 Hi, I’m Claudia Peñaloza, a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where going data-driven can be an adventure. What started as a proof of concept a few years ago, evolved into Conti’s first-ever Predictive Machine Learning Model for R&D! A wedding, two babies, three lateral moves, and four hires later, our team had also evolved… from mostly R to mostly Python developers. Rewriting 1000+ commits? No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms. The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "114 A shiny web app that calculates all solar and lunar eclipses for up to the next 75 years visible at your current lon/lat coordinate location ([link][1]). The shiny app leverages the swephR High Precision Swiss Ephemeris package for celestial body calculations. Anecdote ======== I witnessed the sky darken for no apparent reason in the fall of 2023. Months later I realized I was witnessing the October 2023 annular solar eclipse. So I began to wonder: How many other eclipse events have I been missing? Broad Topics Covered ==================== Julius Caesar vs Pope Gregory XIII: The Battle for Space-Time ------------------------------------------------------------ While most of the western world adopted the Gregorian calendar (365.2425 days long) by the 20th century for agricultural and cultural reasons, astronomers track time off-earth using the older Julian calendar (365.25 days long). We will briefly touch on why this is, how to convert back-and-forth between Gregorian and Julian to perform astronomical calculations, and other notable phenomena to keep in mind when using R in space. User Input: Flexibility vs Ease-of-Use ====================================== Specifically with regards to earthly longitude/latitude coordinate inputs (required for calculating the alignment of celestial bodies to a Earth-bound viewer), a decision had to be made affecting usability of the shiny app for the end-user based on their ability to easily enter an input location: The Breadth of the swephR Package ================================= The swephR package is useful for calculating not only solar and lunar eclipse events visible from earth but all kids of celestial alignments including: - Planetary positions - The crossing of planets over positions - Fixed star positions - Orbital periods for the Earth, asteroids, etc Biography --------- Tim Bender, Hobbyist Bachelor of Urban Planning from the University of Cincinnati. ~15 years local government experience as an urban planner and transit planner. Tim was part of a team that helped deploy Google Transit for his transit agency in Kentucky in 2008, being among the first 50-ish agencies worldwide to go live. Journey with R began with a desire to log transit vehicle real-time location data from an API for analysis but I had no programming experience or knowledge of how to approach the problem. I wouldn’t successfully solve this problem until after about 5 years of self-guided learning.

       "115 Shiny has long been a framework of choice for interactivity dashboards on the web, but what if you need a mobile variant? This talk proposes new ways to extend existing Shiny dashboards to mobile dashboards by using Ionic and JavaScript, while making use of a Rust server for data manipulation and preparation. We'll analyze the integration of Shiny with a mobile frontend Shiny, the benefits offered by Rust in terms of backend efficiency, and the tradeoffs offered between web-based and mobile dashboard interfaces. Finally, we'll assemble everything with a live working proof of concept mobile application that streams a Shiny dashboard into a simplified and responsive user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "116 The field of computational paleontology is rapidly advancing with many recently developed open-source R packages leading the charge for more standardized, reproducible, and open research. This push is a relief for many data-science-minded paleontologists who have previously toiled over writing their own scripts to download, clean, analyze, and visualize their data. Many of these steps are now covered by functions in these new packages (and those of other packages in the R universe). However, this push for more script-based research may introduce a wrench in the existing scientific workflows of less technical researchers who lack a background in coding or cause a greater learning curve for new researchers introduced to the field. Therefore, bridging the gap between visual, hands-on workflows and digital, code-based workflows is imperative to the collaborative future of computational paleontology. Here I present a new Shiny app, paleopal, that provides a user-friendly interface to build paleontological data science workflows. The app connects existing paleontological R packages such as palaeoverse and deeptime with the tidyverse suite of R package to encourage standardized scientific pipelines. Furthermore, the app uses the shinymeta R package to provide a live code and results panel and a downloadable RMarkdown script for the pipeline. Altogether, paleopal aims to spearhead the next generation of training of computational paleontologists, regardless of age, background, or technical expertise. Further, the modular nature of the app introduces an avenue for other fields to fork and adapt the project for their own needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "117 Quarto’s clean and simple API is one of its greatest strengths. This ease of use extends to creating Quarto extensions as well. In this talk, we will document the details and process we took to create our Quarto extension, Flourish. Flourish allows users to dynamically target text in code chunks, like functions or parameters, and apply styling (e.g. highlighting) in the rendered document. If you are familiar with the R package Flair, Flourish works similarly, but is language agnostic. We will speak in depth about how Flourish dynamically injects styling into a rendered report using Javascript, and the work it took to get to this process. This talk seeks to inform participants of our extension and its technical workings, as well as step them through our process of creating a Quarto extension, showing how simple it can be to extend Quarto’s functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "118 Adopting new open-source technology can be both exciting and challenging. While a tool may appear promising and seem like the perfect fit for a specific task, early-stage technologies often come with their own set of hurdles. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of comprehensive resources—such as detailed documentation, practical examples, active discussion boards, and community support—which can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues or fully understand the tool’s capabilities. This often requires additional effort, experimentation, and problem-solving to get things working as intended. At last year’s Posit Conference, I was introduced to a new tool called closeread, a Quarto extension designed for vertical scrollytelling. The concept immediately caught my interest because it seemed like an innovative way to enhance storytelling with data. Motivated by its potential, I decided to give it a try shortly after the conference. However, my initial experience was challenging. The tool was only partially functional, and when I encountered technical issues, I struggled to find enough supporting resources to resolve them. The available documentation was limited, examples were scarce, and there wasn’t much discussion happening in community forums. Frustrated by these obstacles, I eventually set the tool aside, unsure of how to move forward. Some time later, I came across a user-contribution contest that reignited my interest in closeread. This contest motivated me to tackle the tool again, but this time with a different mindset. Instead of relying solely on available resources, I approached the problem more systematically—digging into the code, experimenting with different configurations, and learning through trial and error. This hands-on approach, combined with the fresh motivation from the contest, helped me overcome the technical challenges I had faced earlier. Eventually, I was able to get the tool working successfully, and in the process, I gained a deeper understanding of how to navigate the common pitfalls associated with adopting new technology. In my talk, I will share this learning journey in detail, highlighting the strategies that helped me move from frustration to success. I’ll discuss practical approaches for overcoming deployment challenges, including how to troubleshoot effectively when documentation is limited, how to leverage community resources even when they seem sparse, and how to maintain motivation when progress feels slow. I’ll also offer insights into the mindset shifts that can make a big difference—like viewing challenges as opportunities to deepen your technical skills rather than as roadblocks.                     \n",
       "119 In this talk, we will share recent work on [parsermd](https://github.com/rundel/parsermd) R package and its use for the programmatic manipulation of Quarto and R Markdown documents. The talk will include a brief overview of the underlying technical details of the parser and abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of these documents in R. Additionally, we will present work to support a number of use cases for these tools to solve practical problems. Examples include building documents that have multiple output variants (e.g. assignments with or without solutions included) and utilities built to support grading and feedback for assignments based on these document formats. Finally, we will discuss our future development plans for the package and related tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "120 Reproducible teaching materials (1) help students understand the usefulness of reproducibility, (2) facilitate pedagogy around meaningful, data-driven statistical applications, and (3) allow other instructors to iterate on course materials. In this talk, I show how a variety of R packages and Quarto work together to produce useful, simple and aesthetic reproducible course materials. I discuss how to weave R-code into lectures, embed reproducible visualizations and animations, and easily host data sets as well as downloadable R scripts on a public course website developed with Quarto. I showcase an undergraduate Bayesian statistics course taught at Duke University in Spring 2025 as an example of reproducible statistics pedagogy and provide tutorial-like instructions to adapt the methods to other courses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "121 In Python, Rust, Go, and many other languages, code formatters are widely loved. They run on every save, on every pull request, and in git pre-commit hooks to ensure code consistently looks its best at all times. In this talk, you'll learn about Air, a new R code formatter. Air is extremely fast, capable of formatting individual files so fast that you'll question if its even running, and of formatting entire projects in under a second. Air integrates directly with your favorite IDEs, like Positron, RStudio, and VS Code, and is available on the command line, making it easy to standardize on one tool even for teams using various IDEs. Once you start using Air, you'll never worry about code style ever again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

The development recently spiked thanks to generous contributions from the community (over 100 pull requests), introducing improved async logger; new formatter, helper, and appender functions; documentation updates; and a hex logo!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "123 Creating a reproducible environment for data analysis pipelines is challenging, due to the wide range of dependencies involved—from data inputs and external tools to system libraries and R packages. Although various tools exist to simplify the process, they often focus exclusively on R package dependencies and omit the system ones, rely on user-supplied metadata, or create an unnecessarily large environment. We present `r4r`, a tool that automatically traces all dependencies in a pipeline using system call interception. Based on these traces, `r4r` generates a Docker image containing precisely the dependencies needed for reproducible execution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a collection of R Markdown notebooks from Kaggle, illustrating how `r4r` helps ensure fully reproducible workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "124 Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for accelerating data analysis, offering flexibility through a natural language interface. The wizrd package was born for testing the hypothesis that LLMs can be used to implement functions within larger data science tools and workflows. With wizrd, users can parameterize model inputs, implement logic that delegates to R functions, and constrain outputs to specific R data structures. Finally, configured models can be converted into actual R functions, which can in turn serve as tools for other models, forming a graph of agents. LLM-based programs can be imported from the Langsmith hub, realizing their portability across languages. We will give an overview and demo of the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "125 # TL;DR In this presentation, I will show how you can move from running your Futureverse R code in parallel on your local computer to a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers shared among friends - all with a single change of settings. Any user with R installed can contribute their compute power when idle and harness others when needed. # Abstract The Futureverse framework revolutionized parallel computing in R by providing a simple, unified API for parallel evaluation of R code. At its core, the future package allows developers to write code once (e.g. `f <- future(lm(x, y))`), which then may be evaluated on any future-compatible parallel backend. For instance, `plan(multisession)` parallelizes on the local machine, `plan(cluster)` and `plan(mirai_cluster)` can parallelize on a set of local or remote machines, and `plan(batchtools_slurm)` distributes the computations on a Slurm high-performance compute (HPC) cluster, and so on. Regardless of backend used, getting the value of the future is always the same (e.g. `v <- value(f)`). In this presentation, I introduce a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) future backend that enables distributed parallel computing among friends and colleagues using shared storage. The shared storage can be a local file system or a cloud storage. I will illustrate this concept using the `plan(p2p_gdrive)` backend, which leverages Google Drive as a communication medium, where users can offload computational tasks to peers in a shared workspace. When a user creates a future, it ends up in the “todo” folder, where idle peers can detect it, download it, and execute it locally. Once completed, the result is uploaded to the “done” folder, making them available for retrieval by the original user. The Futureverse ecosystem has a simple API, which makes it is easy for anyone to write parallel R code. Because Futureverse is exceedingly well-tested, you can easily and safely scale up code currently running on your local computer to run on distributed P2P clusters. This approach democratizes distributed computing, allowing R users to harness the collective power of their social network without requiring dedicated HPC infrastructure. Come to my talk and learn how you and your friends can get together and share your compute resources, allowing you to run `y <- future_lapply(X, my_long_running_analysis)` across their computers, while you share your idle compute resources with them. All this is available from your local R prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "126 Have you ever run out of memory or time when tidying data, making a visualization, or training a model? An R user may find their laptop more than sufficient to start their journey with statistical computing, but as datasets grow in size and complexity, so does the necessity for more sophisticated tooling. This talk will step through a set of approaches to scale your tasks beyond in-memory analysis on your local machine, using the Postron IDE: adopting a lazy evaluation engine like DuckDB, connecting to remote databases with fluent workflows, and even migrating from desktop analysis entirely to server or cloud compute using SSH tunnelling. The transition away from a local, in-memory programming paradigm can be challenging for R users, who may not have much exposure to tools or training for these ways of working. This talk will explore available options which make crossing this boundary more approachable, and how they can be used with an advanced development environment suited for statistical computing with R. Integrations in the Positron IDE make all these tasks easier; for example, remote development in Positron allows an R user to seamlessly write code on their local machine, and execute that code on a remote host without tedious interactions outside the IDE. Whether you train statistical models, build interactive apps, or work with large datasets, after this talk you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "127 While R is an expressive language for exploring and manipulating data, it is not naturally suited to working with datasets that are larger than can fit into memory. However, modern tooling, including Parquet files, the Arrow format, and query engines like DuckDB, can expand what is possible to do with large datasets in R. Using practical examples, this talk will introduce several packages that bring these tools into R with intuitive interfaces, and demonstrate how to adopt them to work efficiently with large datasets. It will also show how these tools unlock new opportunities, such as easy access to data in cloud storage, and will explore recent developments in the Arrow and Parquet ecosystems, including for geospatial data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "128 Sparse data, data with a lot of 0s, appear quite often in modeling contexts. However, existing data structures such as data.frames or matrices doesn't have a good way of controlling them. You were forced to represent all data as sparse or dense (non-sparse). This means that many modelings workflows uses an non-optimal data structure, that at best slows down computation and at worst won't be computational feasible. This talk will cover how we overcame these issues in tidymodels. Starting with the creation of a sparse vector format that fit in tibbles followed by the wiring needed to make it happen in our packages. The best part is that most users doesn't need to change anything in their code to benefit from these speed improvements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
